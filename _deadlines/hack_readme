# IT SEEMS THAT JEKYLL'S "DATE" FIELD CAN ONLY SERVE TO ONE PURPOSE:
# TO BE THE DATE WHEN SOMEHTING HAPPENED, THAT IS, -ED, IN THE PAST.
#
# IN OTHER WORDS, FUTURE DEADLINES CAN'T BE ESTABLISHED THROUGH THIS.
# FIELD, NEITHER CAN THE DATE FORMAT BE USED ANYWHERE ELSE LIKE THIS.
#
# AS THE QUICKEST, SIMPLEST HACK, I'LL BE USING "2015", NOT "2015".
# WHEN DISPLAYING THAT INFORMATION, I'LL BE HIDING THE 'YEAR' VALUE.
