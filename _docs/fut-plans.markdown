Since when I became a language teacher, I have wondered about ways to make language learning more efficient and less frustrating. My involvement with this thesis project was deep from the beginning, and I do not plan to change this after graduation. As an instructional designer and a passionate language teacher, I intend to continue developing **LanguageBug**. 

### Network

I am not by myself anymore, as I was at the beginning of my thesis course. Now, there is a team of at least three people (*Amanda Leticia*, *Daniel Negri*, and *Ludmilla Aires*, all thesis committee members) who are interested in keeping this project active.

### Accomplishments

Similarly, I have now a considerable amount of structured research to justify my decisions and a working proof-of-concept prototype. This means that it is much easier now to advocate for this project than it was a year, or even six months ago.

### Release

A working prototype of **LanguageBug** is already accessible to anyone on [http://languagebug.org](http://languagebug.org). But I would really like to make arrangements for a more structured release of a Beta version of the app to the general public.

### Open-source

**LanguageBug** is licensed under the GNU Affero GPL License, therefore, anyone can also access, download, and even redistribute the source code of the app through [github.com/guibueno/guibueno.github.io/](github.com/guibueno/guibueno.github.io/).

A next step would be to approach different communities of interests (language enthusiasts, instructional designers, ...) to look for other collaborators.

### Academy

Finally, a one-year thesis project seemed to be more than enough time to develop the **LanguageBug** app, but it was not. I consider the possibility of applying for a Ph.D. program where I could further develop the research and the design of **LanguageBug**.

Not at this very moment, though. Maybe in a few years?
