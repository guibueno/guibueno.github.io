### Annotations

[1] As explained in the *Target Learners* section, according to the conceptual framework of *Andragogy*, adult learners are identified as self-motivated and self-directed (Knowles, 1989; Merriam, 2001).

[2] [3] *Context*: 30% of American smartphone owners check their phones even when at a meal (Lookout Mobile Security, n.d.), but **LanguageBug** is designed to be challenging and to require complete concentration.

#### As described in the *Design Rationale* section:

[4] **LanguageBug** focuses on helping language learners build up their speaking skills. *Exercises* are intensive speaking practices that prompt learners to produce utterances in the target language.

[5] Learners can access the rationale behind each *Principle* and each *Exercise* within **LanguageBug**. This metacognitive information helps them reflect on their own approach to language learning.

[6] The *self-asessment video* feature is designed to help learners notice their own progress. As their speaking skills increase after each practice, they are able to see their evolution video after video.

#### As described in the *Landscape Audit* section:

[7] *Speaking*: most language learning applications rarely prompt learners to speak. Speech prompts are also limited to simplistic sentences or even single words, resulting in reduced progress in speaking.

[8] Rather than prompting users to speak, these language learning apps are mostly based on matching mini-games. Learners merely tap on words to find appropriate translations for (usually irrelevant) sentences.

[9] *Right/Wrong*: after each "wrong" question, learners lose a few seconds correcting and re-submiting their answers. Their working memories stop dealing with language learning and begin to operate the app.

#### Expected results

[10] Learners using **LanguageBug** speak several times the same utterances. After a few practices, they will be able to repeat those utterances by heart and assertively, even in a social context.

[11] Learners using other apps build up skills that mostly useful within those apps. In a social context, it will be hard for them to express what they have learned in a timely way to engage in a conversation.

[12] *Self-assessment videos* make learners aware of their progress. As a result, they will become more motivated (Halvorson, 2013, p. 23) and are likely to remain learning their target languages on **LanguageBug**.
