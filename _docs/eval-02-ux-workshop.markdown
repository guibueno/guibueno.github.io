As part of the thesis course schedule, on March 8th I was part of a *User Experience Workshop* with my peers and the UX Designer Shombit Chatterjee. This event was particularly important because it was the first time I received feedback from peers on an actual design iteration for **LanguageBug**.

### Reveal.js

At that time, I had just chosen Reveal.js as my prototyping platform. In its essence, Reveal.js is a presentation framework, not a prototyping tool. Therefore, unlike any actual prototyping tool, Reveal.js does not have:

- a graphical user interface (GUI), which means that all of the development had to be done using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.
- built-in graphic assets (buttons, icons, etc), and
- mobile function pre-sets (sliding, side menu, etc)

On the other hand, Reveal.js offers some valuable affordances, which is why I had chosen it as my main tool for the moment:

* It allows for responsiveness to almost any user action,
* all aspects of the prototype are completely flexible and customizable,
* unlike most prototyping tools, it supports integration with audio files,
* it runs on any browser and platform, just like a regular website page.

### My questions

Still unsure about the efficacy of Reveal.js in this context, I was looking for feedback on how to make the usability of **LanguageBug** align with the majority of apps. I was wondering at the time:

* Is my prototype intuitive? Is it easy to use?
* Why doesn't it look/feel like a mobile app?

More importantly, I was doubting if my prototype would be engaging, which was why I had signed up for an UX workshop in the first place. I would be constantly asking myself:

* Will my peers respond to the command prompts?
* Is the flow of texts happening too fast?
* Will they be confused by so much information?
* Does my prototype make it clear where I'm heading to?

### My presentation

The only section of **LanguageBug** I had prototyped was the *Speak Fast* principle. Principles are a set of practical instructions given in English to scaffold users on how to best operate the **LanguageBug** app.

The particular purpose of *Speak Fast* is to make learners speak aloud at a challengingly fast speed according to the application prompts.

My peers, who have never seen me teaching using those strategies, opened this prototype and immediately began to follow its instructions. Quiclky, they began to respond to the prompts by speaking.

As the principle practice continued, they reacted appropriately to the new prompts and began to speak all those words louder and faster. The whole test lasted only about 30 seconds, but was extremely effective.

### Feedback

I was very surprised and satisfied with what I was seeing! My peers had immediately engaged with my prototype and looked very excited with that whole experience. Their enthusiasm and compliments were crucial to solve my doubts and relieve my initial fears:

* My prototype is intuitive and easy to use.
* Not looking like a typical mobile app does not seem to be a problem.
* My peers have responded to the command prompts with enthusiasm.
* Too much information increased their focus and was not confusing.

Most importantly, the overall purpose of my thesis project finally became clear to them, after months of unsuccessful theoretical conversations. It also became clear to me the importance of prototyping as much and as early as possible.

The flow of text was probably happening a little too fast and should be adjustable, they suggested. One of my peers, Bhavana Budithi, also made a good point that the formatting of the instructions and the sentences should differ more drastically, to which I agreed right away.

Such issues seemed to have minor importance in comparison to the happiness of having finally been able to show my design intentions.
