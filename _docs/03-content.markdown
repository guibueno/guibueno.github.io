  - "Re-frame it completely, giving focus to the language-related content"
  - "List some of the metalinguistic principles I am also targetting"

This project could cover any language.
I'm thinking here about language learning in general.

That said, this project will cover a particular content: **Novice** level **Brazilian Portuguese**. 

### Brazilian Portuguese

But I'm choosing only Portuguese for this prototype.
This is due to more pragmatic reasons than anything else.
(1) I am a native speaker, therefore, an expert.
(2) Finding potential user testers among my peers is easy.
Any person willing to learn a little Portuguese may benefit from contributing to my design process.

### Novice

I have more experience teaching novice learners than advanced.
In fact, I have my own struggles as an advanced/superior life-long English learner.
It is better to help other people succeed in what I have already succeeded.

### Struggles

According to the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL, 2012), Novice speakers usually face problems regarding intelligibility, functionality, participation in a conversational exchange, speed, vocabulary, syntax, and pronunciation. 

As a consequence, the primary focus of this project is to help learners build these competencies and skills. **THIS IS TOO BROAD!**

### Speaking

The most common approach is to divide language learning into the construction of four main skills: reading, writing, listening and speaking. 

This project addresses mainly the **speaking** skill.

### Secondary content domains

Vehicles to learning: trying, risk-taking.

This project also addresses two other areas of focus, **learning** and **trying**, as additional skills.

#### Learning and Trying

The **learning** skill covers metacognitive strategies, which are usually how polyglots and hyperglots accomplish distinguished results in their language learning experiences.

In **trying**, the emotional strategies to overcome shyness and embarrassment will be addressed, as well as techniques for anxiety control, mindset theories, and risk-taking approaches.

#### Language-specific

Based on these competencies (speaking, learning, and trying) and on the idea of customization, this project will cover content types such as, but not limited to, phrases, greetings, cognates, main verbal structures, and self-introduction. Part of the vocabulary involved in the process of acquiring such competencies will depend on the learnerâ€™s goals and interests.

Repeat as you go
