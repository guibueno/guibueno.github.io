After devoting so much time, energy, and effort to the **LanguageBug** project, I am sure that reflections will continue to emerge for years. The thesis blog (or reflection journal) contains deep, formative reflections since the beginning of the thesis course. Here I present my current insights and impressions on my own design process.

Where might it have been improved? What other insights did you encounter along the way? 

### Multiple tasks

Over this entire year, I've been overwhelmed with so many tasks. As a thesis student working on a *Design & Development of Media for Learning*


* Short time-frame for research and development

### Early prototypying

Não avancei muito no que eu já sabia





* Prototypying as early as possible

* Collaboration with other people from different areas

* User tests with more people that do not know anything

* A group of collaborators that are willing to learn portuguese

### Final Project

* Paper writing was complicated

* Difficulty of conducting research and design development

* Encouraged to work in partnerships

### Problem / Learners

* Do not assume everything is not working

* Everyone has takes on language learning
