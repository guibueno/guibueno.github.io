After devoting so much time, energy, and effort to the **LanguageBug** project, I am sure that reflections will continue to emerge for years. The thesis blog (or reflection journal) has contained sincere, formative thoughts since the beginning of the thesis course. Here I present my current insights and impressions on my design process.

### Research & Development

As a thesis student working on a *Design & Development of Media for Learning*, I was responsible for managing both

1. the *research* on the problem I was addressing, and
2. the *development* of a product that would address this problem. 

I experienced a lot of difficulty and anxiety balancing these two tasks.

#### Mostly research

Most of that difficulty in managing my time resulted from my difficulty in making decisions and complying with deadlines.

During the first semester, I had already a clear notion of what I wanted to develop. However, I tried to focus on validating my ideas from a scientific perspective. As a result, I did too much research and advanced too little. 

#### Mostly prototypying

In the second semester, I began to develop my thesis project website and my first prototypes. I spent most of my time dealing with codes and prototyping software, having meetings with developers, and sketching visual illustrations.

As a result, finishing my final paper on time was especially challenging.

#### Other tasks

In addition to *research* and *development*, I had course-related responsibilities such as:

* Updating my reflection journal from time to time;
* Setting up and meeting with a committee of contributors;
* Conducting class presentations and class activities;
* Maintaining a routine of accountability for advisors and peers;
* Preparing a final presentation for the ECT Design Expo; etc.

Each one of these tasks helped me develop valuable skills. However, I might have set up wrong priorities at different points. As a result, I experienced a lot of difficulties balancing between these course-related responsibilities and my core goals (*research* and *development* of my thesis project).

### Lessons learned

As a consequence, I have learned some remarkable lessons, such as:

* early prototyping may be a better first step than doing research;
* dialogue with other individuals from different areas is necessary; 
* user tests are more valuable than prototyping development; and
* when possible, speaking directly to your target audience is enlightening.

These and other lessons I have learned during the development of my thesis project are part of most design manuals. But, only through my own experience and struggle, I was able to validate them.
