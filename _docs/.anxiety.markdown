Factors associated with foreign language anxiety

**Emotion:**

On the issue of Language Learning Anxiety, Torres & Turner (2014) review that:

*"Researchers further suggest that students who experience high levels of anxiety may have difficulty acquiring a FL (Gregersen, 2003; Horwitz, et. al, 1986; Marcos-Llinás & Garau, 2009). As such, FL anxiety has been found to be negatively associated with language achievement (Awan, Azher, Anwar, & Naz, 2010; Horwitz, et. al, 1986)." (p. 86)*

To that problem, Torres & Turner (2014) suggest that "creating a low anxiety atmosphere at the onset of the semester could help ease students’ negative language learning experiences." (p. 99). */
