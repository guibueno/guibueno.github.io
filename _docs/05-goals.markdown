title: Goals
---

The main goal of this project is to help learners that do not know any or close to any Portuguese become novice-level Portuguese speakers (1) in a reduced amount of time. In addition to that, it is intended to prepare learners to make the most out of their opportunities to learn and practice (2) and to prepare them to use their skills in authentic situations (3).

    <td>B</td>
    <td>Learners will be able to handle interactions needed for basic survival in a context where the target language is spoken.</td>
    <td>Example: Basic personal information, basic objects, activities, preferences, and immediate needs. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>C</td>
    <td>Learners will be able to respond to simple, direct questions or requests for information in the target language.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>Learners will be used to reflecting about their learning experiences, as opposed to merely following instructions.</td>
    <td>Example: asking/answering "what for?" every time before a new exercise or practice.</td>

  <tr class="diff">
    <td>B</td>
    <td>Learners will be able to customize what they intend to learn and to explain the reasons why  each exercise is the appropriate choice.</td>
    <td>Example: defining language goals and asking “how can I accomplish this goal?”</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>C</td>
    <td>Learners will understand the role of making mistakes and exploring their vocal apparatus in order to produce new phonemes.</td>
    <td>Example: avoid seeking perfection at early stages. Becoming able to try out new sounds.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="diff">
    <td>D</td>
    <td>Learners will understand that their abilities are flexible and may change over time, especially through deliberate practice.</td>
    <td>Example: escaping from the “good or bad with languages” mindset and establishing concrete goals.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>Learners will transform their attitude towards an approach that values risk-taking, rather than fears making mistakes.</td>
    <td>Examples: being comfortable with making mistakes, due to the fact that they are completely expected.</td>
