These are the ideal conditions under which **LanguageBug** is designed to work best: private environment, unaccompained, mostly mobile, distraction-free, optmized time.

### Private environment

Learners will have a better experience at a private environment where they can freely speak aloud without any concerns. Houses and personal office rooms are examples of ideal study places.

### Unaccompained

Studying alone is a great way for language learners to loosen themselves to speak freely with no fear of making mistakes. It also helps them maintain focus and to keep their own pace.

### Mostly mobile

Learners will be able to use **LanguageBug** on different platforms, both mobile and computer-based. The goal is to facilitate access to the training practices, independently on which device the learner owns.

Also, mobile devices are key entry points to online services. Today "19% of Americans rely to some degree on a smartphone for accessing online services" (Pew Research Center, 2015).

### Distraction-free

It is a common practice to use apps during free time, like while watching TV or having dinner. In fact, 30% of American smartphone owners check their phones even when at a meal (Lookout Mobile Security, n.d.).

However, language learning practices require a great deal of focus from learners. Therefore, their exclusive attention should be devoted to **LanguageBug**, otherwise it will not be possible to reach the full experience.

### Optmized time

Language training in **LanguageBug** consist of brief, timed practice activities, which should range from 1 to 5 minutes. Therefore, even short breaks (i.e. at work) can be used for these meaningful, intense practices.
