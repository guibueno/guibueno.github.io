I conducted user tests with two of my peers who agreed to be recorded and identified: Nissa and Nicole. 

(04/25) Nissa - Greetings - Needed clues sometimes. Laughing a lot. Spanish and Latin helped.
(04/25) Nicole - Talk About Yourself - hitting tables

Both really smiley and happy, but also stressed. Signs of effort. Hitting tables, touching hair for example.
Both above average performance, which may indicate above average interest.

GOOD or BAD? Keep or try it?
Making it social, maybe?


overly personal presentation approach:
  my name is gui
  studied english for x years
  taught 4 langs
  even the ones i was not profficient
  very critical of the landscape audit
  we could be doing more with less
  i've suffered from language learning anxiety
  languages are taught by apps a people in a terrible way
  sense of compleition
  right/wrong
  grammar
  attitude
  all bad approaches

draft approach:
  tis presentation is not completed
  my thesis is not completed
  it's all a work in progress
  i don't even speak fluent english
  this shouldn't all be a problem
  development is more important
  process over product
  need for a language learning tool that adopts that
  right/wtong binary
  grammar
  correct, grades, green lights
  these are all behaviors that inhibit learners
  self-improvement, kaizen should be the focus
  we like to iterate as designers
  on the assumption that doing it many times makes you do it right,
  but we think of our learners as people who need to get things right
  we think of our design products as fixed, products from a competitive perspectve
  how much our we still relying on the transmission model?
  we create standards and tests,
  we inhibit learners and make them 

   and 
  we think of assessment as proofs that learning has happened,
  without taking into account each persosn' individual trajectory
