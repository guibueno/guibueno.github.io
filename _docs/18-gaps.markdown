This projects currently has significant gaps, when it comes to features that may have not been prototyped, planned, or even imagined. Some of these gaps could easily be fixed, while others would need a fair amount of research before implementation. 

Here is a comprehensive (and growing) list of the gaps I have identified.

#### Feedback

Currently, the self-assessment proficiency video feature is the only form of assessment available for learners. It would be great if other forms of feedback could be introduced.

#### Responsiveness

As learners engage in an exercise practice or principle training, multiple encouragement prompts are displayed, such as *"You did great!"*. These prompts are not responsive, that is, they are automated, pre-established messages that will play independently on the learners' performance.

However, according to Saffer (2009), “we need to know that the product ‘heard’ what we told it” (p. 64). In other words, clever designs are delightful, while the current "dumb" encouragements are not.

#### Personalization

If the system could get more information from the learners and make personalized suggestions based on that data, the experience of using **LanguageBug** would be optimized.

#### Growth Mindset

Noels & Lou (2015) have noted how learning technologies may easily foster a growth mindset:

> Such subtle messages can also be delivered electronically, involving less time and resource commitment, and less teacher training. For instance, a study of over 250,000 Khan Academy students learning mathematical concepts online promoted a growth mindset with an onscreen header that stated, "when you learn a new kind of math problem, you grow your math brain." This intervention increased the rate at which students successfully solved math problems compared to controls, and the effect was seen for months after the message was removed from the website (p. 49)

Fostering a growth mindset on learners could help increase reselience and motivation. This was one of the cornerstones of **LanguageBugs** at the beginning, but was taken out of the project to reduce its scope.

#### Exercise Levels

This could be a way to make users do the same activity with increasingly challenging goals over and over again. But how to incorporate levels in the exercises? When would the learners advance levels, since there is only a self-assessment system? Would the learners choose when to advance? Would this keep their motivation? More iteration is needed to answer these questions.

#### Prior Learners

Currently, there is not any way through which new **LanguageBug** user with prior experience with Portuguese learners could be placed in more advanced stages, since there is no level distinction.

#### Statistics

It would be nice to include a dashboard with more quantified data, where learners would have a better sense of what they have accomplished.
