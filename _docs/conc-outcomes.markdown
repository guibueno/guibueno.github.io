Experiences from ECT Design Expo
* Not social

How well do you feel your project addresses these goals?

* Simple technology
* Not too much resources
* Short time-frame for research and development

* Working prototype
* A lot of engagement
* Received with sympathy

* It does make learners speak
* However, lack of other features
* Makes people speak

* Principles are cool,
* But do not convince learners
* With me by their side, this can happen

* Training for the use of other platforms

* Seems to be very disengaging
* Lack of interaction, power point-ish

* Addresses foreign language anxiety efficiently

* Is an efficient tool, but not by itself yet
* Need for an instructor to accompany learner

* It does provide learners with tools and strategies to learn languages

* Lack of interaction was a problem
* Mechanism to keep users engaged and focused
