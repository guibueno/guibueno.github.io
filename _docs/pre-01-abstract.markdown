**Abstract:** *LanguageBug: a speak-first approach to language learning* is a mobile-based software designed to teach Novice-level, Brazilian Portuguese to self-motivated, adult learners. *LanguageBug* focuses on helping learners build the *speaking* skill, but also presents metacognitive principles based on growth mindset to address the problem of foreign language anxiety. The main features of *LanguageBug* are: *exercises* (structured prompts to engage learners in speaking practice), *self-assessment videos* (where learners can record themselves speaking Portuguese to assess their formative progress), and *principles* (which scaffold learners to understand and apply efficient language learning strategies). The learning theories and design principles that support *LanguageBug* are: Constructivism, Cognitive Load Theory, and Embodied Cognition.
