From the previous sections, a few important things should be clear now.

### Challenges

First, there is no need for another language learning <a href="/01-not-another-method.html">method</a>. Too many methods exist and, in fact, there is a shortage of evidence to support that methods actually facilitate language learning.

Second, language learning software are typically designed to work apart from each other. There is a need for learners to <a href="/01-introduction/02-integration.html">integrate</a> them, that is, to know how to navigate and make good use of such sea of resources. 

This means that learners need to constantly make <a href="/01-introduction/03-decision-making.html">decisions</a> on *what* resources to use and, most importantly, *how* to use these resources to <a href="/01-introduction/04-practice.html">practice</a> and build up their language skills.

### Synthesis

These challenges indicate that there needs to be a tool that:

1. shows language learners how to practice language skills efficiently

2. and explains such efficient learning strategies,

So that learners can use these learning strategies to deal with all the language learning resources (authentic and language-based) that are available on the internet.
