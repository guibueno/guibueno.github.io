When discussing how to make language learning more efficient, the word "**method**" immetiately comes to mind. But in language learning, methods have mostly been characterized by a strict purism that is now outdated.

In fact, Brown (2002, p. 10) has listed several reasons for academics and researchers to give up with an "obsession" with language learning methods. This list includes the following items:

* It is hard to empirically test, verify, and validate language pedagogy,
* Methods are usually too prescriptive and overgeneralized,
* Methods become indistinguishable as learners reach advanced levels.

However, **LanguageBug** is not being designed to become a language learning method, but an approach. To fully understand what this claim means, we should look back on the designer methods.

### Designer methods

In the 1970s, "in a burst of innovation" (Brown, 2000, p. 10), several language teaching learning methods were created. Nunan (1989) calls these **the designer methods**.

The designer methods consisted of: *Community Language Learning*, *the Silent Way*, *Suggestopedia*, *Total Physical Response*, and a few others.

### EXAMPLE: Total Physical Response

In order to understand what these methods meant and still mean, and how to approach them, let's analyze the **Total Physical Response** method, also widely known as the **TPR method**.

#### Functioning

TPR is one particularly unconventional example of a designer method, created by Dr. Asher (1969), psychologist at San José State University.

 Archer observed that children “in learning their first language appear[ed] to do a lot of listening before they speak” and that “their listening is [was] accompanied by physical responses” (Brown, 2000, p. 30). 

Based on these observations, Archer proposed the TPR method. Its functioning relies on very specific and limited roles in the classroom:

- teachers give commands in the target language (*"Sit down!"*),
- students react to these commands physically (*they sit down*).

No other actions or activities are part of the TPR method, which means that all language learning should occur exclusively through physical reactions to voice commands.

#### Pros

A great deal of physical engagement makes TPR a really fun method for some students. Also, TPR can be "especially effective in the beginning levels" (Brown, 2000, p. 30).

In the field of **embodied cognition** (Lee, 2014), TPR might offer an interesting case study. For example, it would be fruitful to assess how much these body movements might contribute to memory retention.

#### Cons

Would it be possible to teach an abstract word, such as "socialism", through TPR? What about idioms, such as "Bite off more than one can chew" or "Elephant in the room"? Probably not.

TPR is notably limited in terms of what can be taught through it (Widodo, 2005, p. 240). There is obviously not one body movement associated with every word or phrase in a language. 

#### Balance

Today, it has become rare to find an exclusive TPR classroom, where speaking, writing, and reading are not allowed. Still, some strategies and activities taken from the TPR method remain popular among teachers.

### The end of the designer methods

Although the designer methods should be applauded “for their innovative flair”, we now acknowledge that they were “not the godsend that their inventors and marketers hoped they would be” (Brown, 2000, p. 25).

Just like in TPR's case, the other designer methods are now unpopular and considered limited. But, similarly, each of them has also left its own legacy of findings, achievements, and teaching strategies.

Brown (2002) coined the expression **Post-Method Era** (p. 9) to refer to this moment, when practices that come from different, fundamentalist methods can be integrated into a single approach.

### The post-method Era

In Brown's characterization (2000, p. 13), while in the 1970s language teaching consisted of many competing methods, it is "now more aptly characterized by a relatively unified, comprehensive ‘approach’".

Galante (2014) defines the Post-Method Era as a “shift from using methods in the purist sense to recognizing that the nature of language learning is complex and nonlinear” (p. 58).

*Image 1* summarizes this whole trajectory from the designer methods to the post-method era. It ends with the acknowledgement that "*there is no single right way to learn languages*"
