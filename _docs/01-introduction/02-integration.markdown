If your target language is widely spoken, it is likely that you will **not** have any problems finding learning resources on the Internet. Still, learning this language may oftentimes be challenging and even demotivating.

Why? In other words, what is missing? How to fill in this gap? In order to answer these questions, we should first try to understand the broad landscape of resources that are currently available.

Let's begin by distinguishing these services and materials between two categories: **authentic resources** and **language-based resources**.

### Authentic resources

#### Definition

Materials that have a primary purpose other than helping people learn languages or providing any sort of language assistance. 

#### Example

An English learner may watch *Citizen Kane* or read *The New York Times* in order to build up reading and listening skills. However, neither the film nor the newspaper were produced with the primary purpose of instructing language learners.

#### Availability

The realm of authentic resources for language learners is essentially endless. It ranges from all sorts of user-generated content (posts on a blog, Twitter page, or Facebook profile, comments, ...) to corporate generated content (newspapers, media channels, company websites, ...).

### Language-based resources

#### Definition

Materials created with the primary purpose of helping people learn languages or providing any sort of language assistance.

#### Example

A workbook called "Learn English Now! - Beginner" might include several texts in English, but they would all be tailored to suit the expertise level of the learner. Vocabulary lists, explanations, assessment questions, and discussion prompts might follow these texts.

#### Availability

Language-based resources for language learners are extremely abundant on the Internet. To illustrate that, *Table 1* offers a rough division of these resources, services, and products into functional categories.

Due to many overlaps, such categories may look slightly arbitraty. For example, some blogs may also have YouTube channels, just like some products may offer more than one service. 

In addition to that, this list is not exhaustive, that is, besides the few examples within parenthesis, it is likely that many other products could be added to almost all categories.
