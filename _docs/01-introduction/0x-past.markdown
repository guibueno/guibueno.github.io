### Language learning technologies from the past

But when it comes to language learning technology, are we shifting towards the "Post-Method" era? Can we say that the language learning websites, apps, and services recognize that language learning is complex and nonlinear? The history of computers applied to language learning does not provide any evidence that this is an actual tendency. 

Warschauer & Healey (1998) roughly divide the history of Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL), into three stages: behaviouristic CALL, communicative CALL, and integrative CALL.

In the behaviouristic CALL period (1960s and 1970s), computers mostly featured the "repetitive language drills, referred to as drill-and-practice (or, pejoratively, as 'drill-and-kill')" (p. 57) (Image 2). In other words, computer were merely “mechanical tutors which never grew tired” (p. 57), that prompted automated, linear, fixed exercises. Learners could not customize or adapt neither the content nor the nature of those exercises, which negatively impacted their motivation.

Subsequently, the communicative CALL period emerged in the late 1970s, rejecting behaviouristic approaches at the theoretical and the pedagogical level:

"Proponents of communicative CALL stressed that computer-based activities should focus more on using forms than on the forms themselves, teach grammar implicitly rather than explicitly, allow and encourage students to generate original utterances rather than just manipulate prefabricated language" (Warschauer & Healey, 1998, p. 57)

The beginning of 1990s is when the integrative CALL period began. It reflected a shift in language teaching theory and practice from a "cognitive view of communicative teaching to a more social or socio-cognitive view" (Warschauer & Healey, 1998, p. 58). In other words, it placed emphasis on language use (task-based, project-based, and content-based), especially in authentic contexts.

According to Warschauer & Healey, this period would integrate technology and language learning, as well as integrate the four language skills (listening, speaking, reading, and writing) into one. But these authors speak from a standpoint in 1998, when a lot of hope and fascination was coming from the "multimedia networked computer - with a range of informational, communicative, and publishing tools now potentially at the fingertips of every student" (p. 58).  Two decades after this article was published, what has the integrative period become and accomplished?
