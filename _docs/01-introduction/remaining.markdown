### Language learning technologies from the past

But when it comes to language learning technology, are we shifting towards the "Post-Method" era? Can we say that the language learning websites, apps, and services recognize that language learning is complex and nonlinear? The history of computers applied to language learning does not provide any evidence that this is an actual tendency. 

Warschauer & Healey (1998) roughly divide the history of Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL), into three stages: behaviouristic CALL, communicative CALL, and integrative CALL.

In the behaviouristic CALL period (1960s and 1970s), computers mostly featured the "repetitive language drills, referred to as drill-and-practice (or, pejoratively, as 'drill-and-kill')" (p. 57) (Image 2). In other words, computer were merely “mechanical tutors which never grew tired” (p. 57), that prompted automated, linear, fixed exercises. Learners could not customize or adapt neither the content nor the nature of those exercises, which negatively impacted their motivation.

Subsequently, the communicative CALL period emerged in the late 1970s, rejecting behaviouristic approaches at the theoretical and the pedagogical level:

"Proponents of communicative CALL stressed that computer-based activities should focus more on using forms than on the forms themselves, teach grammar implicitly rather than explicitly, allow and encourage students to generate original utterances rather than just manipulate prefabricated language" (Warschauer & Healey, 1998, p. 57)

The beginning of 1990s is when the integrative CALL period began. It reflected a shift in language teaching theory and practice from a "cognitive view of communicative teaching to a more social or socio-cognitive view" (Warschauer & Healey, 1998, p. 58). In other words, it placed emphasis on language use (task-based, project-based, and content-based), especially in authentic contexts.

According to Warschauer & Healey, this period would integrate technology and language learning, as well as integrate the four language skills (listening, speaking, reading, and writing) into one. But these authors speak from a standpoint in 1998, when a lot of hope and fascination was coming from the "multimedia networked computer - with a range of informational, communicative, and publishing tools now potentially at the fingertips of every student" (p. 58).  Two decades after this article was published, what has the integrative period become and accomplished?

### Integration vs. Distribution

Warschauer & Healey (1998) accurately state that in the integrative CALL period, "students learn to use a variety of technological tools as an ongoing process of language learning and use, rather than visiting the computer lab on a once a week basis for isolated" (p. 11). This is true when it comes to the broad nature of language learning services that are available, as shown in Table 1.

**Table 1** - Rough division of language learning services into categories

It should be clear that there are many overlaps between such categories, for example, some blogs may also have YouTube channels, and some alternative methods can foster their own language exchange communities. Also, besides the few examples in the parenthesis, there are uncountable others for pretty much any of the categories above. The list of resources is essentially endless.

So, what is missing? In other words, with so much information and so many services, why is it still hard for most people to learn languages and which design product could fill this gap? This project argues that in the so-called integrative period, language learning tools and information has only become more distributed. Therefore, even with uncountable resources at hand, language learning is still a hard task that most learners have difficulty pursuing.

### Customized, deliberate practice

Now that most language learners have access to a huge amount of distributed language learning services, the challenge is help them integrate such tools into their own experiences. Instead of a new language learning platform, this project offers guidance in how to use the available services in a reflected and self-regulated way to foster expertise (Scott & Ghinea, 2014, p. 169).

Motivation is one of the keywords in self-regulated learning and the best way naturally increase motivation is through efficacy. When learners see that their investments of time and effort result in concrete improvement, they are likely to become more motivated. According to the psychologist Heidi Halvorson (2010), motivation directly reflects the quality of the expected success:

people are motivated to do anything as a function of (1) how likely they are to be successful and (2) how much they think they will benefit from it. And of course the more motivated you are, the more likely you are to reach your goal. (p. 23)

In order to define their specific goals and realistic expectations, learners needs their metacognitive skills. This project intends to make its users constantly "think about thinking", that is, reflect about each use of their time in regards to their learning goals. The goal is to convince learners to adopt a growth mindset in language learning, rather than a fixed one (Dweck, 2006). Noels & Lou (2015) have noted how learning technologies may easily foster growth mindset:

Such subtle messages can also be delivered electronically, involving less time and resource commitment, and less teacher training. For instance, a study of over 250,000 Khan Academy students learning mathematical concepts online promoted a growth mindset with an onscreen header that stated, "when you learn a new kind of math problem, you grow your math brain." This intervention increased the rate at which students successfully solved math problems compared to controls, and the effect was seen for months after the message was removed from the website (p. 49)

Mindsets influence resilience (Diener & Dweck, 1980; Yeager & Dweck, 2012) and "metacognitive monitoring can beneficially impact decisions about what to study" (Winne & Azevedo, 1014, p. 71). Metacognition plus growth mindset means that the learner will be empowered to decide what to study, when to study, and for what reason. This autonomy makes learners much more thoughtful than if they were merely following instructions given by a teacher or learning platform.

In order to remain motivated, learners make informed decisions on how to proceed with language learning. When learners engage in activities that are not interesting, relevant, nor efficient, their experience may result in frustration. This is one of the "cognitive-affective barriers that reduce the amount of deliberate practice that students engage in" (Scott & Ghinea, 2014, p. 169). This project has the ultimate goal to reduce the risks of frustration in a language learning experience.
