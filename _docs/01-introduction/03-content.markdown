This project addresses an audience defined by a psychological profile. Learners with the outlined characteristics exist in different countries and may be willing to learn a diverse array of languages, for different reasons, with unique goals in mind. Customization is the main philosophy behind this approach to learning, therefore different cases should be considered at all times.

That being said, this project will cover a particular content: **Novice** level **Brazilian Portuguese**. The reasons for such choice are more pragmatic than design oriented: as a Brazilian living in New York, not only am I a content wise expert, it is also simple to find potential users and testers. Any person willing to learn a little Portuguese may benefit from contributing to my design process.

According to the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL, 2012), novice speakers usually face problems regarding intelligibility, functionality, participation in conversational exchange, speed, vocabulary, syntax and pronunciation. As a consequence, the primary focus of this project is to help learners build these competencies and skills.

The most common approach is to divide language learning into the construction of four main skills: reading, writing, listening, and speaking. This project addresses mainly the **speaking** skill, but also makes the point that such division may be widely taken for granted. The two other areas of focus, that is, the additional skills that this project addresses are **learning** and **trying**.

The **learning** skill covers metacognitive strategies, which are usually how polyglots and hyperglots accomplish distinguished results in their language learning experiences. In **trying**, the emotional strategies to overcome shyness and embarrassment will be addressed, as well as techniques for anxiety control, mindset theories, and risk-taking approaches.

Based on these competencies (speaking, learning, and trying) and on the ideal of customization, this project will cover content types such as, but not limited to: phrases, greetings, cognates, main verbal structures, and self-introduction. Part of the vocabulary involved in the process of acquiring such competencies will depend on the learnerâ€™s goals and interests.
