From the previous sections, a few important things should be clear now.

### Challenges

First, there is no need for another language learning <a href="/docs/01-introduction/01-not-another-method.html">method</a>. Too many methods exist and, in fact, there is not much evidence to support them.

Second, language learning softwares are typically designed to work apart from each other. There is a need for learners to <a href="/docs/01-introduction/02-integration.html">integrate</a> them, that is, to navigate and make good use of such sea of resources. 

This means that learners need to constantly make <a href="/docs/01-introduction/03-decision-making.html">decisions</a> on *what* resources to use and, most importantly, *how* to use these resources to <a href="/docs/01-introduction/04-practice.html">practice</a> and build up their language skills.

### Synthesis

These challenges signalize that there needs to be a tool that:

1. shows language learners how to effectively practice language skills and explains such effective learning strategies,

2. so they can use these learning strategies to deal with all the language learning resources (authentic and language-based) available on the internet.
