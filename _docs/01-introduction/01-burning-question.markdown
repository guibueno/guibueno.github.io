In my lifelong involvement with language learning and brief experience as a language teacher, one question has always intrigged me: **how might we make language learning more efficient**?

Of course, this question is not new.

In fact, in a pursuit of better practices in language teaching, several methods have come and gone over the past hundred years, some in total "philosophical opposition to others" (Brown, 2000, p. 16)

But learning languages is often still perceived as being "harder than other subjects" and even “demotivating” (Ward, 2014), or causing "decreased motivation, frustration and anxiety" (Bernat; Gvozdenko, 2005).

In the realm of educational technology, I found that most language learning softwares are reproducing typical classroom approaches, where there could me more ambitious innovations (see: [Landscape Audit](/docs/01-introduction/06-landscape-audit.html)).
