### Self-assessment

Learners won’t have anyone telling them whether what they are pronouncing is accurate. Rather, they will have access to a proficiency video feature, where they can record themselves and keep track of their progress in a self-assessment approach, so that they can see their improvement and keep themselves motivated.


in this screen it is shown the last ones. **LanguageBug** suggests to record new videos in a certain period of time and usage, but the person is free to create new ones whenever they feel like. Under the videos there is a quick link (record yourself) that takes the user to the Record Yourself Speaking screen (Image 12), where it is possible to record a new video. The user can either swipe right to see more videos or click on Your Performance to go to the Performance page (Image 11).

**Annotations**

Here I present quotes and fragments of studies that support different parts of this design rationale. Such studies need still to be categorized and incorporated into a single, linear description of this project’s design features and decisions. However, here they are roughly divided by topics:

**Emotion:**

On the issue of Language Learning Anxiety, Torres & Turner (2014) review that:

*"Researchers further suggest that students who experience high levels of anxiety may have difficulty acquiring a FL (Gregersen, 2003; Horwitz, et. al, 1986; Marcos-Llinás & Garau, 2009). As such, FL anxiety has been found to be negatively associated with language achievement (Awan, Azher, Anwar, & Naz, 2010; Horwitz, et. al, 1986)." (p. 86)*

To that problem, Torres & Turner (2014) suggest that "creating a low anxiety atmosphere at the onset of the semester could help ease students’ negative language learning experiences." (p. 99). 

Samuel & Larraza (2015) state that "accepting a ‘‘wrong’ pronunciation is really not an error at all – it is an efficient adaptation to the prevailing linguistic environment" (p. 51). This realization helps students reduce their anxiety towards not pronouncing words correctly in their target language. Also, Hartshorn (2013) has showed that many students unequivocally or consciously aim for accent retention, rather than accent reduction. In other words, such students are willing to keep pronouncing their target languages with accent, since that will be a distinctive feature to express and maintain their cultural identity.

**Metacognition:**

Yang & Chen (2014) recommend that:

* "... instructors should train students to master the skills of acquiring cultural knowledge rather than only teach ‘culture as facts’, such as famous events, heroic figures. Culture is dynamic. All the knowledge of a culture is relevant to time, region, and even individuals. By only remembering facts about a culture, students cannot become good communicators with native speakers, unless they are able to update their knowledge constantly. Thus, instructors need to emphasize the skills of acquiring cultural knowledge, through a series of consistent activities" (p. 12).*

Similarly, this project does not aim to teach vocabulary, grammar, and structures to its users, but to help them learn how to acquire a foreign/second language. This approach requires metacognitive knowledge and enhances learners’ perception on their target languages. Nesbitt (2013) also state that learners should have "access to activities that help increase their strategic competence", that is, activities that help learners build such metacognitive knowledge.

Oberg & Daniels (2013) qualifies purely self-paced and independent studies, "where students fully determine their own schedule and pace" (p. 179) as naturally challenging, involving burdens on the student. On the other hand, it has also been proved that it produces high levels of cognitive engagement, meaningful connections and increased motivation (Kinzie, 1990).

**Growth Mindset:**

According to Halvorson (2010), "psychologists refer to the desire to get better - to develop or enhance your skills and abilities - as a mastery goal." (p. 61), and “when people run into trouble in pursuit of get-better goals, they don’t get depressed and helpless … - they take action. They ask themselves what they are doing wrong, and they fix it.” (p. 62). Metalingua will acknowledge the difficulties of learning a foreign/second language and helping students frame their learning as a *mastery goal*, rather than a performance goal. This not only will help learners reduce their foreign language anxiety, but also frame them within a *growth mindset*, rather than a *fixed* one.

**Risk-taking:**

Sung & Tsai (2014) showed that "the learners in the study expressed their preference to receive clarifications and elicitations types of feedback, which help them find correct answers themselves." (p. 39). In their extensive literature review on Corrective Feedback (CF), the authors also address the “several controversial issues regarding CF, such as whether CF assists in language acquisition, what types of CF are most effective, what factors influence the effectiveness of CF” (p. 38). This project approaches mistakes as an essential part of learning a foreign language, therefore, since learners are at the very beginning of their Portuguese learning journey, CF is avoided at all costs. Rather than correcting the learners and inhibiting their risk-taking potential, Metalingua will be designed to help learners perceive and correct their own mistakes.

**Deliberate Practice:**

Ferreira (2014) shows that "current practices of grammar instruction are connected to prescriptive approaches, outdated, disconnected from linguistic theory, and ineffective at improving communicative skills" (p. 14) and provides evidence that merely exposing students to grammar is not the most efficient approach. 

This project focuses on building speaking skills only through deliberate practice supported by metacognitive strategies. Therefore, it treats the learning of grammar as "an organised and progressive work of observation and systematisation of major paradigms and regularities of language" (p. 18), as Ferreira (2014) considers it.
