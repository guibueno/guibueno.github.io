title: Prototype
layout: doc
section: dev
incomplete: yes
problem: "although the prototype is ready, I still need to make a write-up on it"
workon:
  - "Choose a series of screens to explain"
  - "Include screenshots from reveal.js prototypes"
  - "Highlight the differences between wireframe/prototype screens"
  - "Hopefully, expand the prototype a little bit"
