My involvement with this project has been pretty intense!

Ever since my experience as an English teacher, I have been thinking of ways to make language learning more efficient and less frustrating. As an instructional designer and a passionate language teacher, I intend to continue developing **LanguageBug** after graduation.

Hopefully, not by myself anymore, but engaged with a community of people who share the same interests.

I would really like to release parts of **LanguageBug** to the general public, under a Free/Open Source Software license. By doing so, it would be possible to share/fork all the work and discussion with other enthusiats.

With all that, I believe I can understand better what I am actually designing, and how to present it to general public. Hopefully, this will also help me fill some (if not all) the gaps that **LanguageBug** still has.

Finally, having one entire year to develop a thesis project sounds like a lot of time, but it is not. How awesome would it be to have some extra time? 

I would personally love to keep developing **LanguageBug** and investigating the field of **language learning technologies** in a PhD. Maybe in a few years?
