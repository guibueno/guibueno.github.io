My involvement with this project was (still is!) very intense. Ever since my experience as an English teacher I have been thinking ways of making the language learning process more efficient and less frustrating. As a designer and as a passionate language teacher, I intend to continue developing LanguageBug, not by myself anymore as a thesis project, but engaged with a community of people who are also interested in this service. I want it to be more accessible to the public, with more crowd sourced discussions, ideas and hands on activities. With that, I believe we can understand better how to present all this principles and informations, and hopefully fill all the gaps we still face.
Also, I would love this to continue to evolve as my PhD project, so that I can further study and analyse this field with an academic eye, which I creates uma base mais s√≥lida para o LanguageBug approach
