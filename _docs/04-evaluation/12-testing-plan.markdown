### Goal

Testing **LanguageBug** will result in insights on usability, such as:  

- see if the mechanics works well,  
- if the features are easy to access and user friendly,  
- figure out the gaps I need to address  

and the efficiency of the current design in the learning process. Also, we can better understand how people react to this learning approach and how motivated they get at the end of the session.

### Research method

We will use a qualitative approach, where participants will first use and test our current version of *LanguageBug*, followed by a one-on-one interview.

### Recruitment strategy 
(who, how many, where will you find, etc)

Our target participants are adults who does not speak Portuguese. They will be selected through a quick online [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/12VRYNiSausPkOfFtaqPWu12kPYB-qwK0PhMY_1JBxTU/edit?usp=sharing_eid&ts=57116ed1), based on their interest in learning Portuguese. We expect from 6 to 10 participants.

### Location

The research will be conducted at Magnet.

### Assitance
(solo, or will you have someone helping you to take notes, etc)

The research will be conducted by myself, interviewing, and Amanda, one of my committee members, who will be there to help me take notes and record the session.

### Recording

We will record the session and our participants speaking what they have learned of Portuguese at the end. We will also take notes of what participants think about their experience.

### Material
(e.g. sketches, wireframes, prototypes, actual pages?)

We will use our prototype for testing.

### Specific questions
(e.g. for usability tests, what tasks, for focus groups/interviews, what questions)

1. Short interview asking participants their current motivation to learn Portuguese and their previous experience in learning languages (if they have).

2. Participants will explore LanguageBug freely, using it the way they feel like.

3. Participants will perform a specific exercise.

4. Interview asking participants their current motivation to learn Portuguese, what they feel about the app, the approach, the learning experience.

### Testint the test

We will test our script in the first two interviews with the participants
