From my standpoint in instructional design, it is delightful, but extremely hard to try to understand language learning in depth. 

Experienced linguists and Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) are certainly more qualified than me to debate questions in language learning/teaching with rigorous scientific accuracy.

In fact, even insiders may find this a hard task, since there are some fundamental questions that remain open-ended in the field of second and foreign language learning and/or acquisition. 

For example, in a long-standing debate known as the critical period hypothesis (Lightbown; Spada, 2006, p. 93), linguists have yet to reach consensus if the learning languages is biologically linked to age or not.

Similarly, it may be difficult to agree on what makes someone a good language learner, on how foreign accents develop, or on why children may seem to learn languages so fast.

### The outsider's challenge 

But in my lifelong involvement with language learning and brief experience as a language teacher, one question has always intrigged me: **how might we make language learning more efficient**?

Of course, this question is not new.

In fact, in the pursuit of best practices in language teaching, several methods have come and gone over the past hundred years, some in total "philosophical opposition to others" (Brown, 2000, p. 16)

But learning languages is often still perceived as being "harder than other subjects" and even “demotivating” (Ward, 2014), causing "decreased motivation, frustration and anxiety" (Bernat; Gvozdenko, 2005).

Besides that, not too much innovation has occurred in the realm of educational technology, where most language learning softwares are reproducing the typical classroom approaches (see: [Landscape Audit](/docs/01-introduction/06-landscape-audit.html)). 

**LanguageBug** was created to address the challenge of increasing language learning efficacy. It does so from an instructional design perspective, through investigation, research, and testing.
