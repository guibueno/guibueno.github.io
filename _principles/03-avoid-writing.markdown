It is very common to associate writing with studying. That's because most times we are taking lessons, there is a notebook with us. This is actually a great habit that most people have since school time. Writing things down can definitely be helpful.

But these exercises are designed to be paper-less and distraction-free. If you stop to write down every time you don't want to forget anything, you will end up losing concentration. The less concentrated you are, the less information you will retain.

So, how about you start to think of **LanguageBug** as your interactive notebook? You can always access here all the words and expressions you are learning. Why would you bother to write things down? Make better use of your time: speak!
