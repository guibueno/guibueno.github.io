title:  "Speak Out Loud"
---
Welcome to our speak-first approach! This is the core principle of this whole app: speak. Don't simply read. Speak. Don't mumble. SPEAK. Out, loud, as clear as you can. You need to do that, otherwise you will be using **LanguageBug** all wrong.

Find yourself a comfortable place where you have no distractions. Then, make sure that you can freely speak aloud. You may feel a little self-conscious If there are people around you, so try to find an empty room or a distant place. You'll be speaking a lot!
