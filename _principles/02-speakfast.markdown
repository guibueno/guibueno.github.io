title:  "Speak Fast"
---

Most language classes will make you speak s-u-p-e-r s-l-o-w when you're a student. I know it's hard to pronounce foreign sounds at the beginning, but paying too much attention to each phoneme will not help. It will make you bored, maybe overwhelmed too.

Also, guess what? Speakers of any language do *not* speak in real life as slowly as in language classes. On the contrary, we're cnnectin' letters'and sounds'all the time. By speaking fast from the beginning, you'll be better prepared to understand native speakers.

Yes, speaking fast may sometimes be challenging. But, wait, isn't that cool? You will keep your focus, plus you won't be wasting time. In fact, by making it all fast-paced, you can do MORE exercises in LESS time. Simple as that.

<!--
why: 
  - "It's harder to speak faster, so you'll have to fully concentrate."
  - "People do <em>not</em> speak in real life as they do in language classes"
  - "Spend less time in each exercise and so you'll do <em>more</em> exercises"
