title:  "Keep Focused"
---
Multi-tasking is a trend, so you're probably used to use learning apps while also texting your friends, watching TV, and eating a slice of pizza. Of course, reducing the attention you give to your practice will impact the progress you will make.

That's why this whole app will try to keep you focused (but, please, cooperate with us!). No buttons, no keyboard, no speech recognition, everything happening so fast that if you're doing more than one thing at the time, you'll miss it all.
