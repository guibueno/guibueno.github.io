title:  "You will not remember"

It would be good if we all had a photographic memory, but that's not the case. That being said, do not worry about memorizing every single word you see in the exercises. This will happen naturally and at your own pace as you keep practicing. 

Think about these exercises as if they were gym workouts, for example. Imagine that your "muscles" will get stronger each time you perform an exercise. Without hurry, you will gradually be able to lift more and more weight as you keep practicing.
