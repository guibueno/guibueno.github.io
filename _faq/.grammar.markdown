No grammar! **LanguageBug** does not address any grammatical topic in a deliberate way at any time. On the contrary, it seeks for a communicative approach.

### Grammar

Ferreira (2014) provides a comprehensive overview of the debate around declarative grammar in the classrooom. In her words:

> "current practices of grammar instruction are connected to prescriptive approaches, outdated, disconnected from linguistic theory, and ineffective at improving communicative skills" (p. 14).

According to Mohamed (2006), states that the teaching of declarative grammar only remains an issue due to the lack of training of teachers.

### Communicative Skills

Also according

isn't a simple task of presenting labels and rules one expects students to memorise

"an organised and progressive work of observation and systematisation of major paradigms and regularities of language" (p. Ferreira, 2014, 18).
