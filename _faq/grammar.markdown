Ferreira (2014) shows that "current practices of grammar instruction are connected to prescriptive approaches, outdated, disconnected from linguistic theory, and ineffective at improving communicative skills" (p. 14) and provides evidence that merely exposing students to grammar is not the most efficient approach. 

This project focuses on building speaking skills only through deliberate practice supported by metacognitive strategies. Therefore, it treats the learning of grammar as "an organised and progressive work of observation and systematisation of major paradigms and regularities of language" (p. 18), as Ferreira (2014) considers it.
