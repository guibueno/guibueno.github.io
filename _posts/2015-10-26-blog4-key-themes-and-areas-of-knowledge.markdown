**Prompt:** What are specific key themes and/or areas of knowledge addressed by your thesis? Draw a diagram and explain their relationships.  

Drawing a diagram was fun and helpful. It became easier to identify gaps in my assumptions through such "object to think with". Just like all the other Thesis assignments ad blog posts, this is an on-going draft that I intend to keep improving. I appreciate any feedback. :)
