title: Design Rationales
date: 2015-02-02 00:00:00 -0700
participants: Nissa Syverson
where: MAGNET Room 821
duration: 60min
topics:
- The differences and similarities between Logic Models and Design Rationales
- Next steps on improving the Design Rationale and adding Learning Theories
- The difficulty and the challenges of making a real Landscape Audit in my case
- Detailed explanation of current low-fi prototype sketch and current plans to develop it
results:
- Logic Models show design features in perspective with long-term goals.
- Design Rationales show design in perspective with short-term goals.
- Design Rationales links the design features with the learning theories
- Both ones display the design features, with more or less detailed info
- How to improve my current design rationale
- Make it more visual. Maybe a table? Maybe a Logic Model structure? Mind-map?
- Display my specific design decisions, rather than an overview of the functionality
- Suggestions to work on the Landscape Audit
- Work with the inherent intention to set the stage to show my product.
- Expand the explanation on why a few (if not each) of the “X” was marked.
- Reframe some of the cornerstones, maybe combine or adjust them as needed.
- Preparing an informal pitch can be a great strategy to help explain the project.
- It would be nice to add some “situated cognition” perspective, besides drilling.
- The idea of having a SAMPLE of beginner learners is cool. But not only that.
- Knowing the goals does tend to help increase motivation. This is Constructivism.
- There is a need to define better DELIBERATE PRACTICE
- Nissa does understand the kind of practice I’m looking for.
- Though, it would be nice to differentiate this from others.
- There are many ways to practice anything / many types of practice.
- Maybe, the idea is to introduce to “Fry your brain” concept. How?
- Keeping it challenging. (Speak to Shashank)
- Making activities always fast-paced?
