results:
  - "I am confident I can finish my thesis paper in time and I cannot apply for an extension."
  - "If I had done everything on time, I would not be overwhelmed with multiple tasks now."
  - "I should prioritize the <strong>evaluation</strong> and <strong>development</strong> sections of the paper."
  - "Of course, I also need to prioritize my Design Expo <strong>poster</strong> and <strong>presentation</strong>."
  - "I should develop a better design rationale, such as Marty's, to explain my design decisions."
  - "Wireframe and prototype sections only show the screens I have made, without tehory/explanation."
  - "Narrative could help in the presentation, and anything that does so is always valid/worth it."
  - "Re-submit paper with Evaluation and Rationale by the end of this weekend (04/30)."
