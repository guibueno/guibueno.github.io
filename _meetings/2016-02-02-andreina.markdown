participants: Others
where: MAGNET Room 821
duration: 30min
topics:
- How to improve my Landscape Audit, since it is so linked to MILESTONE#1
- It is clearly insufficient, but I’m not sure how I should approach it.
- I depend on the main concepts/cornerstones, which are likely to change.
- Too many services, so that was the only approach I could find to do it.
results:
- Dividing it into CATEGORIES is useful and helpful when there are too many products.
- However, I should choose those categories based on DESIGN FEATURES, not concepts
- It is too hard to visualize what metacognition, for example, means in a landscape audit
- If I remain focused on the design features, it’ll remain valid.
