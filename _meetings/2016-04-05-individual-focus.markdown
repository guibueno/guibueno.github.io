results:
  - "Feedback on lesson (by Nissa)<ul>
  <li>Took our whole focus</li>
  <li>Good to do it all at once rather than single people out</li>
  <li>A little hard to have the visual written tied to the pronunciation</li>
  <li>Got a little frustrated sometimes when saw longer sentences</li></ul>"
  - "Design challenge (also by Nissa)<ul>
  <li>'I can't hear you, can you say that louder?'</li>
  <li>Maybe be able to tell app a word i'm having particular trouble with, so maybe system can give sentences that use that a lot, or way to practice that word more</li>
  <li>Mini logic model around video recording idea</li>
  <li>What assumptions am I making? would it be motivating? freak people out to hear/see themselves.</li>
  <li>maybe one assumption: seeing evidence of practice could be useful</li>
  <li>Way to control speed?</li>
  <li>Recording should be your best - at the end of the session... maybe force them to watch at the beginning of the next session.
  some kind of time lapse comparison over time (edited)</li>"
