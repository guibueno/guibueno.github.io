I'm a second-year MA student in the Digital Media Design for Learning [(DMDL)](http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/alt/ect/ma/requirements/) program at NYU. 

I majored in Media Studies at [UNICAMP/Brazil](http://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/?language=en) (2009-2013), where I was granted two academic scholarships to study:

* Journalism at the [Universidad Complutense de Madrid](ucm.es) (Fall 2011), and
* [Media, Culture, and Communication](http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/mcc/) at NYU (Fall 2012-Spring 2013).

I have worked as a Journalist for [Open Knowledge Brasil](http://br.okfn.org) and as a language teacher. 

Now, I'm finishing my thesis in second and foreign language learning and acquisition. Human Centered Design, Growth Mindset, and Metacognition are my main topics of interest.
