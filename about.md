<p>Hello, I'm Gui Bueno! I’m a second-year MA student in the Digital Media Design for Learning <a href='http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/alt/ect/ma/requirements/'>(DMDL)</a> program at NYU.</p>
<p>I majored in Media Studies at <a href='http://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/?language=en'>UNICAMP/Brazil</a> (2009-2013), where I was granted two academic scholarships to study:</p>
<ul>
<li>Journalism at the <a href='ucm.es'>Universidad Complutense de Madrid</a> (Fall 2011), and</li>
<li><a href='http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/mcc/'>Media, Culture, and Communication</a> at NYU (Fall 2012-Spring 2013).</li>
</ul>
<p>I have worked as a Journalist for <a href='http://br.okfn.org'>Open Knowledge Brasil</a> and as a language teacher.</p>
<p>Now, I’m finishing my thesis in second and foreign language learning and acquisition. Human Centered Design, Growth Mindset, and Metacognition are my main topics of interest.</p>
