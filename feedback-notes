		"extrinsic motivation" in Cognitive Constructivism: why it's nice that nstructions seem like a human is teaching them

		add to the design rationale for principles:

		Finally, perhaps you can include a conclusion of how this design helps " your users speak aloud at a fast speed". I imagine people will create mental model in the working memory while speaking so they can control if their sound is loud enough. While practicing several times, the knowledge of how to control their voice will transfer to long-term memory. Therefore, they remember how to speak at a appropriate speed even they have not practiced for days.

		one little addition I think would make it even stronger is putting all your main different designed prototypes (to highlight you did so many) and then explain how you will use specific examples to show the process of applying feedback. Putting the screen shots of all your designs will serve as a place to showcase the incredible amount of feedback you have received moving you from a web application towards your current design
