<p>Scott and Ghinea (2014) state that “maintaining an ongoing, reflexive, and self-regulated learning process is critical to the acquisition of expertise” (p. 169). They argue that engaging in **deliberate practice **is an important way to achieve those conditions in many areas, such as in computer programing, which they discuss in-depth. The authors also argue that:</p>

<p>“The literature on self-beliefs and motivation shows that mindsets can influence resilience. Students with growth beliefs tend to maintain practice when they encounter difficulty. Those with fixed beliefs do not. Thus, it is important that educators inspire growth beliefs as ongoing practice is important for developing expertise” (p. 171)</p>

<p>As mentioned in the previous section, this project intends to provide language learners with both metacognitive (<strong>learning</strong>) and emotional (<strong>trying</strong>) strategies to make their deliberate practice more efficient. But what is deliberate practice in language learning? Where does it take place and what are the conditions under which it occurs?</p>

<p>Of course, in language learning there is never only one answer to a question. When learners want to invest time in improving their foreign language skills, there is a long list of options from which they can choose what to do. <em>Watching a movie in the target language</em>, for example, may be a good way to improve the listening skill. Table 2 displays a non-exhaustive list of examples:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Activity:</td>
    <td>Skills:</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Watch a movie</td>
    <td>Listening</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Listen to music</td>
    <td>Listening</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sing along</td>
    <td>Speaking</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Read the news</td>
    <td>Reading</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Write texts</td>
    <td>Writing</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Translate texts</td>
    <td>Reading, Writing</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Read books</td>
    <td>Reading</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Speak to native speakers</td>
    <td>Speaking</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Read aloud</td>
    <td>Reading, Speaking</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><strong>Table 2</strong> - Deliberate Practice: examples of activities and the skills they help learners build</p>

<p>Note that <em>taking lessons</em> and <em>traveling abroad</em> are not listed in Table 2, for the simple reason that they are not specific enough. The purpose of Table 2 is to list some very specific tasks a language learner may deliberately choose to perform in order to enhance particular skills. <em>Traveling abroad</em> and <em>taking lessons</em> are merely immersions in environments where some of these tasks may occur.</p>

<p>Each option in Table 2 brings new questions to the language learner. If, for example, one decides to <em>sing along</em>, the immediate question that arises is: which song? Let’s assume the learner knows at least a few artists whose songs are in the target language, which is not always the case. Still, many other important questions arise in the learner’s mind, as exemplified in Table 3.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Singing Along</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Which song should I sing along? What should be the criteria/rationale to choose this song?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What bands/artists do I know in the target language? Do I like their songs?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Which vocabulary am I going to learn through that song? Are those words relevant?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Do I understand the meaning of this song? Is it too figurative or poetic? Is it worth it?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Should I focus on my singing, pronunciation, and accent, or on vocabulary and meaning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Should I sing along the whole song, or is it better to focus on each sentence at once?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>How many times am I supposed to sing to this song? How will I know when I’m done?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What about the speed of speech in this song? Should I practice with faster or slower songs?</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>**Table 3 **- Singing along: the immediate questions and decisions that learners have to face</p>

<p>Having to deal with so many questions and decisions will most likely distance the learner from an effective practice. Rather than focusing completely on the practice itself, the learner’s attention will be divided into answering such questions (and re-assessing the answers), operating different tools (to play and pause the song, to follow the lyrics), and actually singing along.</p>

<p>In other words, extraneous cognitive load will be using too much of the learner’s working memory resources, in lieu of productive learning (Sweller, 2010, p. 43). As a result, not only those simple tasks could become very hard to execute, they would also become much less effective and less pleasant. Such issues can be addressed through design, which is the purpose of this project:</p>

<p>Instruction should be designed to ensure that the bulk of working memory resources is germane to the goal of schema acquisition and automation. In other words, working memory resources should be devoted to dealing with intrinsic cognitive load rather than extraneous cognitive load because schema acquisition is directed to the interacting elements associated with intrinsic cognitive load. (Sweller, 2010, p. 43)</p>

<p>In summary, this project attempts to make deliberate practice more effective by both <strong>reducing the extraneous cognitive load</strong> (<em>less questions/decisions</em>) and <strong>increasing the germane cognitive load</strong> (<em>answering those questions for the user, based on scientific research</em>). It should be noted that the latter is not a direct consequence of the former, as Sweller (2010) explains.</p>

<p>Much of the work on extraneous cognitive load assumed that as that category of cognitive load was reduced, germane cognitive load would automatically increase because learners would devote a similar effort to learning regardless of the effectiveness of the instruction. For that reason, there are relatively few germane cognitive load effects. (p. 44)</p>

<p>Learners will be able to use it through different platforms (mobile, computer) in order to make the best use of their time devoted to language learning. The main goal is to optimize the time so that even really short periods of time (i.e.: <em>a 10-minute break from work</em>) can avail meaningful learning experiences, where the learner feels active and empowered.</p>
