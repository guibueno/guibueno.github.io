<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>In the field of second and foreign language learning and/or acquisition, many fundamental questions remain open-ended. For example, in a long-standing debate known as the critical period hypothesis (Lightbown; Spada 2006, p. 93), linguists have not reached consensus if the capacity to learn languages is biologically linked to age or not. Even if not biologically linked to age, it is not clear why adult learners often find it harder to learn languages, why they learn them with accents, and why children (and polyglots) seem to learn languages much more easily.</p>

<p>In the pursuit of the language learning best practices, several foreign language teaching methods have come and gone over the past hundred years, some in total philosophical opposition to others (Brown, 2000, p. 16). But learning languages is often still perceived as being “harder than other subjects” and even “demotivating” (Ward, 2014). But why? What makes it so hard?</p>

<p>From an instructional design standpoint, these questions represent an unsolved challenge: how might we make language learning more efficient and less frustrating? This work addresses this question through investigation, research, and, most importantly, testing. Presumably, there is a lot to learn from past attempts to improve the efficiency of language learning through Science.</p>

<h3 id="from-the-designer-methods-to-the-post-method-era">From the designer methods to the Post-Method Era</h3>

<p>In the 1970s, “in a burst of innovation” (Brown, 2000, p. 10), several language teaching learning methods were created. Nunan (1989) calls these the “designer” methods: Community Language Learning, the Silent Way, Suggestopedia, Total Physical Response, and others.</p>

<p>Brown (2000) states that such “designer” methods should be applauded “for their innovative flair”, but acknowledges that they were “not the godsend that their inventors and marketers hoped they would be” (p. 25). Brown (2002, p. 10) also lists reasons to give up this obsession with methods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It is hard to empirically test, verify, and validate language pedagogy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Methods are usually too prescriptive and overgeneralized</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Methods become indistinguishable as learners progress to advanced levels.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Dr. Asher (1969), psychologist at San José State University, created the Total Physical Response (TPR) method, one particularly unconventional “designer” method example. It began when Asher observed that children, “in learning their first language appear to do a lot of listening before they speak” and that “their listening is accompanied by physical responses” (Brown, 2000, p. 30).</p>

<p>As a result, the TPR method proposes that teachers should do nothing more than giving students commands in the target language (<em>“Sit down!”) *and let the students react to these commands physically (</em>students sit down*).</p>

<p>Students often find this method fun, especially due to the physical engagement in class activities. TPR may also be good case study for embodied cognition researchers (Lee, 2014). The complete absence of speaking, writing, and reading in a typical TPR class makes this method unique and fascinating to language learning researchers.</p>

<p>On the other hand, TPR is very limited in terms of what can be taught (Widodo, 2005, p. 240). For example, there is obviously not one body movement associated with every word or phrase in any language. Would it be possible to teach the word “socialism” using TPR? Probably not.</p>

<p>Still, some strategies and activities taken from the TPR method remain popular among teachers for being “especially effective in the beginning levels” (Brown, 2000, p. 30). And just like in TPR’s ase, each of the “designer” methods has left its own legacy of findings and achievements.</p>

<p>But while in the 1970s language teaching consisted of many competing methods, it is “now more aptly characterized by a relatively unified, comprehensive ‘approach’” (Brown, 2000, p. 13). Brown (2002) coined the expression “Post-Method” era (p. 9) to refer to this movement, which Galante (2014) defines as a “shift from using methods in the purist sense to recognizing that the nature of language learning is complex and nonlinear” (p. 58).</p>

<h3 id="language-learning-technologies-from-the-past">Language learning technologies from the past</h3>

<p>But when it comes to language learning technology, are we shifting towards the “Post-Method” era? Can we say that the language learning websites, apps, and services recognize that language learning is complex and nonlinear? The history of computers applied to language learning does not provide any evidence that this is an actual tendency.</p>

<p>Warschauer &amp; Healey (1998) roughly divide the history of Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL), into three stages: behaviouristic CALL, communicative CALL, and integrative CALL.</p>

<p>In the behaviouristic CALL period (1960s and 1970s), computers mostly featured the “repetitive language drills, referred to as drill-and-practice (or, pejoratively, as ‘drill-and-kill’)” (p. 57). In other words, computer were merely “mechanical tutors which never grew tired” (p. 57), that prompted automated, linear, fixed exercises. Learners could not customize or adapt neither the content nor the nature of those exercises, which negatively impacted their motivation.</p>

<p>Subsequently, the communicative CALL period emerged in the late 1970s, rejecting behaviouristic approaches at the theoretical and the pedagogical level:</p>

<p>“Proponents of communicative CALL stressed that computer-based activities should focus more on using forms than on the forms themselves, teach grammar implicitly rather than explicitly, allow and encourage students to generate original utterances rather than just manipulate prefabricated language” (Warschauer &amp; Healey, 1998, p. 57)</p>

<p>The beginning of 1990s is when the integrative CALL period began. It reflected a shift in language teaching theory and practice from a “cognitive view of communicative teaching to a more social or socio-cognitive view” (Warschauer &amp; Healey, 1998, p. 58). In other words, it placed emphasis on language use (task-based, project-based, and content-based), especially in authentic contexts.</p>

<p>According to Warschauer &amp; Healey, this period would integrate technology and language learning, as well as integrate the four language skills (listening, speaking, reading, and writing) into one. But these authors speak from a standpoint in 1998, when a lot of hope and fascination was coming from the “multimedia networked computer - with a range of informational, communicative, and publishing tools now potentially at the fingertips of every student” (p. 58).  Two decades after this article was published, what has the integrative period become and accomplished?</p>

<h3 id="integration-vs-distribution">Integration vs. Distribution</h3>

<p>Warschauer &amp; Healey (1998) accurately state that in the integrative CALL period, “students learn to use a variety of technological tools as an ongoing process of language learning and use, rather than visiting the computer lab on a once a week basis for isolated” (p. 11). This is true when it comes to the broad nature of language learning services that are available, as shown in Table 1.</p>

<p>**Table 1 **- Rough division of language learning services into categories</p>

<p>It should be clear that there are many overlaps between such categories, for example, some blogs may also have YouTube channels, and some alternative methods can foster their own language exchange communities. Also, besides the few examples in the parenthesis, there are uncountable others for pretty much any of the categories above. The list of resources is essentially endless.</p>

<p>So, what is missing? In other words, with so much information and so many services, why is it still hard for most people to learn languages and which design product could fill this gap? This project argues that in the so-called integrative period, language learning tools and information has only become more distributed. Therefore, even with uncountable resources at hand, language learning is still a hard task that most learners have difficulty pursuing.</p>

<h3 id="customized-deliberate-practice">Customized, deliberate practice</h3>

<p>Now that most language learners have access to a huge amount of distributed language learning services, the challenge is help them integrate such tools into their own experiences. Instead of a new language learning platform, this project offers guidance in how to use the available services in a reflected and self-regulated way to foster expertise (Scott &amp; Ghinea, 2014, p. 169).</p>

<p>Motivation is one of the keywords in self-regulated learning and the best way naturally increase motivation is through efficacy. When learners see that their investments of time and effort result in concrete improvement, they are likely to become more motivated. According to the psychologist Heidi Halvorson (2010), motivation directly reflects the quality of the expected success:</p>

<p>people are motivated to do anything as a function of (1) how likely they are to be successful and (2) how much they think they will benefit from it. And of course the more motivated you are, the more likely you are to reach your goal. (p. 23)</p>

<p>In order to define their specific goals and realistic expectations, learners needs their metacognitive skills. This project intends to make its users constantly “think about thinking”, that is, reflect about each use of their time in regards to their learning goals. The goal is to convince learners to adopt a growth mindset in language learning, rather than a fixed one (Dweck, 2006). Noels &amp; Lou (2015) have noted how learning technologies may easily foster growth mindset:</p>

<p>Such subtle messages can also be delivered electronically, involving less time and resource commitment, and less teacher training. For instance, a study of over 250,000 Khan Academy students learning mathematical concepts online promoted a growth mindset with an onscreen header that stated, “when you learn a new kind of math problem, you grow your math brain.” This intervention increased the rate at which students successfully solved math problems compared to controls, and the effect was seen for months after the message was removed from the website (p. 49)</p>

<p>Mindsets influence resilience (Diener &amp; Dweck, 1980; Yeager &amp; Dweck, 2012) and “metacognitive monitoring can beneficially impact decisions about what to study” (Winne &amp; Azevedo, 1014, p. 71). Metacognition plus growth mindset means that the learner will be empowered to decide what to study, when to study, and for what reason. This autonomy makes learners much more thoughtful than if they were merely following instructions given by a teacher or learning platform.</p>

<p>In order to remain motivated, learners make informed decisions on how to proceed with language learning. When learners engage in activities that are not interesting, relevant, nor efficient, their experience may result in frustration. This is one of the “cognitive-affective barriers that reduce the amount of deliberate practice that students engage in” (Scott &amp; Ghinea, 2014, p. 169). This project has the ultimate goal to reduce the risks of frustration in a language learning experience.</p>

<h2 id="target-learners">Target learners</h2>

<p>Every language learner (and certainly every learner in general) could benefit from metacognition, growth mindset, and deliberate practice. However, this project specifically targets <strong>adult learners</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="self-motivated">Self-motivated…</h3>

<p>There are many reasons for that. To begin with, adult learners are most likely to be self-motivated, that is, to be sure that they want to know a certain language. For example, an employee who has the chance to work in a different country will know why knowing that foreign language is needed.</p>

<p>In another example, someone looking for a job may look better qualified by knowing how to speak a foreign language. In cases like these, one knows the benefits and goals of learning a certain language, therefore is willing to take action and invest time, energy, and even money into it.</p>

<p>But even those self-motivated learners sometimes do not succeed in learning foreign languages. It may happen for many different reasons, as lack of emotional support from peers and teachers, unrealistically high expectations, and inefficient language learning techniques, etc.</p>

<h3 id="but-discouraged-">… but discouraged, …</h3>

<p>A person that has “failed” to learn a foreign language in the past feels discouraged and frustrated. This frustration may get even more harmful if this person believes that “language learning ability is dependent on some immutable, innate talent” (Mercer, 2012, p. 22), which is a common scenario. Mercer &amp; Ryan (2010) project that:</p>

<p>“It is possible that FLL [Foreign Language Learning] is a domain in which the fixed mindset may be particularly prevalent, given the widespread belief in the importance of natural talent or aptitude in successful language learning” (p. 444)</p>

<p>It might be the case that most people that have “failed” in language learning were actually making a great deal of progress, but were not able notice that. Most language courses are too pragmatic to explain that language learning has many inherent challenges and it is expected to be difficult to overcome some of these challenges. In other words, they lack metacognition and growth mindset.</p>

<h3 id="distrustful-">… distrustful, …</h3>

<p>Besides adult learners being most likely to suffer from frustration and discouragement from a prior, unsuccessful attempt to learn a foreign language, they have to deal with a general discredit for the simple fact that they are adults, therefore less capable of learning languages than children.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, the Critical Period Hypothesis is that “there is a time in human development when the brain is predisposed for success in language learning” (Lightbown; Spada 2006, p. 93).  It is estimated that this critical period would usually end around puberty.</p>

<p>But while “the general consensus is that the younger learner has stronger powers of mimicry and retention, there is no evidence to suggest that adult learners are slower in terms of absorbing new information” (Johnson, 2015).</p>

<h3 id="and-maybe-too-serious">… and maybe too serious.</h3>

<p>Besides their self-beliefs and mindsets, it might be the case that shyness affects more adults than children when it comes to learning languages. Fear of feeling and looking silly, resistance to trying new approaches, and concerns with making mistakes can explain a harsher, stricter approach.</p>

<p>For example, when it comes to speaking skills, it is hard for most adult learners to experiment with produce sounds that go beyond their own phonetic repertoire. This makes it challenging for them to mimic the accents and the pronunciation in foreign languages.</p>

<p>Fortunately, one of the principles of Andragogy is that adult learners are guided by learning goals and tied to logical principles. By explaining to such adult learners the benefits from “loosen up”, it is expected that their capacity to playfully explore their language capacities will expand.</p>

<h2 id="content">Content</h2>

<p>This project addresses an audience defined by a psychological profile. Learners with the outlined characteristics exist in different countries and may be willing to learn a diverse array of languages, for different reasons, with unique goals in mind. Customization is the main philosophy behind this approach to learning, therefore different cases should be considered at all times.</p>

<p>That being said, this project will cover a particular content: <strong>Novice</strong> level <strong>Brazilian Portuguese</strong>. The reasons for such choice are more pragmatic than design oriented: as a Brazilian living in New York, not only am I a content wise expert, it is also simple to find potential users and testers. Any person willing to learn a little Portuguese may benefit from contributing to my design process.</p>

<p>According to the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL, 2012), novice speakers usually face problems regarding intelligibility, functionality, participation in conversational exchange, speed, vocabulary, syntax and pronunciation. As a consequence, the primary focus of this project is to help learners build these competencies and skills.</p>

<p>The most common approach is to divide language learning into the construction of four main skills: reading, writing, listening, and speaking. This project addresses mainly the <strong>speaking</strong> skill, but also makes the point that such division may be widely taken for granted. The two other areas of focus, that is, the additional skills that this project addresses are <strong>learning</strong> and <strong>trying</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>learning **skill covers metacognitive strategies, which are usually how polyglots and hyperglots accomplish distinguished results in their language learning experiences. In **trying</strong>, the emotional strategies to overcome shyness and embarrassment will be addressed, as well as techniques for anxiety control, mindset theories, and risk-taking approaches.</p>

<p>Based on these competencies (speaking, learning, and trying) and on the ideal of customization, this project will cover content types such as, but not limited to: phrases, greetings, cognates, main verbal structures, and self-introduction. Part of the vocabulary involved in the process of acquiring such competencies will depend on the learner’s goals and interests.</p>

<h2 id="context-setting">Context/ Setting</h2>

<p>Scott and Ghinea (2014) state that “maintaining an ongoing, reflexive, and self-regulated learning process is critical to the acquisition of expertise” (p. 169). They argue that engaging in **deliberate practice **is an important way to achieve those conditions in many areas, such as in computer programing, which they discuss in-depth. The authors also argue that:</p>

<p>“The literature on self-beliefs and motivation shows that mindsets can influence resilience. Students with growth beliefs tend to maintain practice when they encounter difficulty. Those with fixed beliefs do not. Thus, it is important that educators inspire growth beliefs as ongoing practice is important for developing expertise” (p. 171)</p>

<p>As mentioned in the previous section, this project intends to provide language learners with both metacognitive (<strong>learning</strong>) and emotional (<strong>trying</strong>) strategies to make their deliberate practice more efficient. But what is deliberate practice in language learning? Where does it take place and what are the conditions under which it occurs?</p>

<p>Of course, in language learning there is never only one answer to a question. When learners want to invest time in improving their foreign language skills, there is a long list of options from which they can choose what to do. <em>Watching a movie in the target language</em>, for example, may be a good way to improve the listening skill. Table 2 displays a non-exhaustive list of examples:</p>

<p><strong>Table 2</strong> - Deliberate Practice: examples of activities and the skills they help learners build</p>

<p>Note that <em>taking lessons</em> and <em>traveling abroad</em> are not listed in Table 2, for the simple reason that they are not specific enough. The purpose of Table 2 is to list some very specific tasks a language learner may deliberately choose to perform in order to enhance particular skills. <em>Traveling abroad</em> and <em>taking lessons</em> are merely immersions in environments where some of these tasks may occur.</p>

<p>Each option in Table 2 brings new questions to the language learner. If, for example, one decides to <em>sing along</em>, the immediate question that arises is: which song? Let’s assume the learner knows at least a few artists whose songs are in the target language, which is not always the case. Still, many other important questions arise in the learner’s mind, as exemplified in Table 3.</p>

<p>**Table 3 **- Singing along: the immediate questions and decisions that learners have to face</p>

<p>Having to deal with so many questions and decisions will most likely distance the learner from an effective practice. Rather than focusing completely on the practice itself, the learner’s attention will be divided into answering such questions (and re-assessing the answers), operating different tools (to play and pause the song, to follow the lyrics), and actually singing along.</p>

<p>In other words, extraneous cognitive load will be using too much of the learner’s working memory resources, in lieu of productive learning (Sweller, 2010, p. 43). As a result, not only those simple tasks could become very hard to execute, they would also become much less effective and less pleasant. Such issues can be addressed through design, which is the purpose of this project:</p>

<p>Instruction should be designed to ensure that the bulk of working memory resources is germane to the goal of schema acquisition and automation. In other words, working memory resources should be devoted to dealing with intrinsic cognitive load rather than extraneous cognitive load because schema acquisition is directed to the interacting elements associated with intrinsic cognitive load. (Sweller, 2010, p. 43)</p>

<p>In summary, this project attempts to make deliberate practice more effective by both <strong>reducing the extraneous cognitive load</strong> (<em>less questions/decisions</em>) and <strong>increasing the germane cognitive load</strong> (<em>answering those questions for the user, based on scientific research</em>). It should be noted that the latter is not a direct consequence of the former, as Sweller (2010) explains.</p>

<p>Much of the work on extraneous cognitive load assumed that as that category of cognitive load was reduced, germane cognitive load would automatically increase because learners would devote a similar effort to learning regardless of the effectiveness of the instruction. For that reason, there are relatively few germane cognitive load effects. (p. 44)</p>

<p>Learners will be able to use it through different platforms (mobile, computer) in order to make the best use of their time devoted to language learning. The main goal is to optimize the time so that even really short periods of time (i.e.: <em>a 10-minute break from work</em>) can avail meaningful learning experiences, where the learner feels active and empowered.</p>

<h2 id="project-goals-and-objectives">Project goals and objectives</h2>

<p>The main goal of this project is to help learners that do not know any or close to any Portuguese become novice-level Portuguese speakers (1) in a reduced amount of time. In addition to that, it is intended to prepare learners to make the most out of their opportunities to learn and practice (2) and to prepare them to use their skills in authentic situations (3).</p>

<h2 id="landscape-audit">Landscape audit</h2>

<p>As described in the Introduction, the landscape of language learning tools and technologies is vast and diverse. This landscape audit only analyzes the <strong>asynchronous</strong> <strong>language courses</strong> category, which also consists of a large group of services. These services can be roughly divided into two groups: (1) traditional, famous and widely used courses and (2) recent, innovative, approaches.</p>

<p>Group (1) corresponds to services that have millions of registered users and typically cover many different languages. The multi-million dollar company Rosetta-Stone qualifies as its main example, followed by Duolingo, a much newer service (2011) that has grown incredibly fast. Other services include, but are not limited to: <a href="http://livemocha.com/">Livemocha</a>, <a href="https://www.busuu.com">Busuu</a>, <a href="https://www.memrise.com/">Memrise</a>, and <a href="https://www.babbel.com/">Babbel</a>.</p>

<p>Group (2) includes services that are not as consolidated, therefore not as well-known, mainly because they were founded more recently. These services are supposedly challenging the most traditional approach to language learning in any manner. Some examples are: <a href="https://www.mangolanguages.com/">Mango Languages</a>, <a href="https://lingvist.io/">Lingvist</a>, <a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/">Fluent in 3 Months</a>, <a href="http://add1challenge.com/">Add1Challenge</a>, <a href="http://baselang.com">Baselang</a> and <a href="http://mimicmethod.com/">The Mimic Method</a>.</p>

<p>Group (1) represents the traditional hegemony of CALL systems, while Group (2) samples what is expected from the current new approaches. In a more detailed version of this landscape audit, I intend to analyze them separately based on how they foster learning and trying, as well as how much customization they allow users to perform.</p>
