### In a nutshell

**Principles** are mini-lessons that walk learners through guidelines, good strategies, best practices, or hints that could increase their efficacy in learning languages. 

### Within the narrative

Language-Bug infection causes leaners to develop "language learning superpowers", which they cannot manage well at first. Principles train users to use these superpowers to learn languages.

### Association with existing resources

There are a few TED Talks about language learning. For example:

* Benny Lewis: [*Rapid Language Hacking*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZqUeWshwMs)
* Young & Jaiswal: [*One Simple Method to Learn Any Language*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1RRbupCxi0)
* Benny Lewis: [*Hacking language learning*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x2_kWRB8-A)
* Sid Efromovich: [*5 techniques to speak any language*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WLHr1_EVtQ)
* Chris Lonsdale: [*How to learn any language in six months](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0yGdNEWdn0)

In each of these talks, the lecturers do not teach any actual content in a specific language (i.e.: vocabulary in Portuguese), but present their own strategies to help language learners become better language learners.

Similarly, **Principles** within the **LanguageBug** app are sections that walk learners through practical strategies to learn languages without necessarily using the Portuguese language whatsoever.

### Functions

* Scaffold learners to use the **LanguageBug** appropriately.
* Make language learners aware of their own learning processes.
* Question widely accepted assumptions in language learning.

### Example: **Speak Fast**

#### What is it?

"*Speak Fast*" is one of the core principles of **LanguageBug**. This means that users will need to follow this guideline (that is, to actually produce speech in a fast-paced way) when performing the exercise practices.

#### Why?

*Speak Fast* may be an efficient strategy for a language learning practice for several reasons, such as:

* It is harder to speak faster, so leaners need to fully focus.
* Real life or native speech is fast and compacted.
* Less time doing each exercise means doing more exercises.

#### Script

Users will be introduced to the principle of *Speak Fast* through timed instructions combined with action prompts, following this script:

1. Show user a simple sentence in English for a few seconds.
2. Ask user to read this sentence aloud.
3. (User reads sentence aloud in a natural pace)
4. *Fast transition*: ask user to perform **3** again, but faster.
5. *Fast transition*: reinforce that reading should be fast.
6. Ask user to keep reading sentences in the same fast pace.
7. Show other sentences in English.
8. *Instruction*: "Now, repeat after the audio"
9. Show/play a few more sentences in English.
10. Transition to words and sentences in Portuguese.
11. *Instruction*: "Keep that sweet spot!"

### Scalability

Creating an exhaustive list of good language learning principles is both impossible and undesired for many reasons, such as:

* there are unlimited learning strategies that could be effective,
* different strategies may work better/worse with different learners,
* new research and publications may challenge current assumptions,

For those reasons, it is likely that principles will be added/removed as I develop my general understanding of how people learn languages.

### Current principles

* Speak fast
* Speak out loud
* Keep focused
* Take risks
* Avoid writing
* You won't remember
