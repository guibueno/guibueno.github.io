### In a nutshell

At the end of each practice, learners can record their own speech in a **self-assessment video**, so they can witness their ongoing progress.

### Within the narrative


### Association with existing resources

In the professional and academic domains, foreign language speakers are often required to take oral proficiency tests. These tests may be administered in-person or thrugh videoconferencing tools.

For example, the New York University (NYU) may require its prospective international students to take *language placement tests*, offered by the American Language Institute (NYU ALI, n.d.). 

Similartly, the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) has been offering a popular test called the *ACTFL Oral Proficiency Interview* (ACTFL OPI) for over 20 years (ACTFL, n.d.).

In these tests, test takers are prompted to produce original speech in the tested language, which certified test takers will then analyze and rate. 

Within **LanguageBug** learners are their own test takers. Despite not having certified technical skills to assess their own speech, learners will certainly be able to notice progress by watching video after video.

### Functions

* Register speech samples continuously.
* Compare current and past speech samples to assess progress.
* Help learners become comfortable hearing their own FL speech.
* Allow learners to share their speech samples with their contacts.

### Example: **User Test**

#### Sample

During the user tests, I simulated the *self-assessment video* feature using the *Wizard of OZ* method (see: User Tests, Results). As a result, there are videos of both users speaking Portuguese after each exercise practice.

Nicole's "Yourself" exercise self-assessment video can be accessed at the following URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNAl6thkpkA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNAl6thkpkA).

#### Regular assessment: Standard framework

If a group of proficiency test takers analyze this video, they will certainly notice that Nicole's performance is marked by evident traces of beginner speech, such as: strong accent, slow pace, unusual rhythm, etc.

As a consequence, Nicole would be labeled a "Novice" speaker and her performance would probably receive a low grade. In this case, Nicole's speech was compared to a certain (so-called) **standard speech**.

#### Self-assessment: Progress framework

When Nicole watched the same video, she certainly noticed her speech differed from the Native speech introduced within **LanguageBug**. It is likely that she could not identify these differences with precision.

But she was also able to notice all the learning she had accomplished in only a few minutes: from not knowing how to say any sentence in Portuguese to knowing a few sentences, even if not perfectly spoken. 

In this case, Nicole is comparing her current self to herself before the practice. **Progress** is the ultimate goal. If Nicole did another exercise practice, it is likely that her performance would be even better.

### Scalability

User-generated videos bring several new affordances to the design of **LanguageBug**. As a result, there could be several enhancements to the *self-assessment video* feature, such as the following:

* Integrate multiple videos into a single "timeline of progress" video, 
* Allow users to follow the videos with their network of learners, and
* Measure/identify the time and content of each video to generate data.

None of these features has been tested our outlined at the moment.

### Current Options

* **Record**: records a video after each practice.
* **Watch**: plays any video recorded by the learner.
* **Share**: outputs the URL of the video on YouTube.

### Theoretical foundation

* Formative assessment
* Self-efficacy
* Self-motivation
* Intrinsic motivation
* Informal learning

    Motivation is one of the keywords in self-regulated learning and the best way naturally increase motivation is through efficacy. When learners see that their investments of time and effort result in concrete improvement, they are likely to become more motivated. According to the psychologist Heidi Halvorson (2010), motivation directly reflects the quality of the expected success:

    > people are motivated to do anything as a function of (1) how likely they are to be successful and (2) how much they think they will benefit from it. And of course the more motivated you are, the more likely you are to reach your goal. (p. 23)


**Emotion:**

On the issue of Language Learning Anxiety, Torres & Turner (2014) review that:

*"Researchers further suggest that students who experience high levels of anxiety may have difficulty acquiring a FL (Gregersen, 2003; Horwitz, et. al, 1986; Marcos-Llinás & Garau, 2009). As such, FL anxiety has been found to be negatively associated with language achievement (Awan, Azher, Anwar, & Naz, 2010; Horwitz, et. al, 1986)." (p. 86)*

To that problem, Torres & Turner (2014) suggest that "creating a low anxiety atmosphere at the onset of the semester could help ease students’ negative language learning experiences." (p. 99). 

Samuel & Larraza (2015) state that "accepting a ‘‘wrong’ pronunciation is really not an error at all – it is an efficient adaptation to the prevailing linguistic environment" (p. 51). This realization helps students reduce their anxiety towards not pronouncing words correctly in their target language. Also, Hartshorn (2013) has showed that many students unequivocally or consciously aim for accent retention, rather than accent reduction. In other words, such students are willing to keep pronouncing their target languages with accent, since that will be a distinctive feature to express and maintain their cultural identity.

### Self-assessment

Learners won’t have anyone telling them whether what they are pronouncing is accurate. Rather, they will have access to a proficiency video feature, where they can record themselves and keep track of their progress in a self-assessment approach, so that they can see their improvement and keep themselves motivated.

in this screen it is shown the last ones. **LanguageBug** suggests to record new videos in a certain period of time and usage, but the person is free to create new ones whenever they feel like. Under the videos there is a quick link (record yourself) that takes the user to the Record Yourself Speaking screen (Image 12), where it is possible to record a new video. The user can either swipe right to see more videos or click on Your Performance to go to the Performance page (Image 11).

**Growth Mindset:**

According to Halvorson (2010), "psychologists refer to the desire to get better - to develop or enhance your skills and abilities - as a mastery goal." (p. 61), and “when people run into trouble in pursuit of get-better goals, they don’t get depressed and helpless … - they take action. They ask themselves what they are doing wrong, and they fix it.” (p. 62). Metalingua will acknowledge the difficulties of learning a foreign/second language and helping students frame their learning as a *mastery goal*, rather than a performance goal. This not only will help learners reduce their foreign language anxiety, but also frame them within a *growth mindset*, rather than a *fixed* one.


**Corretcions**

Sung & Tsai (2014) showed that "the learners in the study expressed their preference to receive clarifications and elicitations types of feedback, which help them find correct answers themselves." (p. 39). In their extensive literature review on Corrective Feedback (CF), the authors also address the “several controversial issues regarding CF, such as whether CF assists in language acquisition, what types of CF are most effective, what factors influence the effectiveness of CF” (p. 38). This project approaches mistakes as an essential part of learning a foreign language, therefore, since learners are at the very beginning of their Portuguese learning journey, CF is avoided at all costs. Rather than correcting the learners and inhibiting their risk-taking potential, Metalingua will be designed to help learners perceive and correct their own mistakes.


**Deliberate Practice:**

Ferreira (2014) shows that "current practices of grammar instruction are connected to prescriptive approaches, outdated, disconnected from linguistic theory, and ineffective at improving communicative skills" (p. 14) and provides evidence that merely exposing students to grammar is not the most efficient approach. 

This project focuses on building speaking skills only through deliberate practice supported by metacognitive strategies. Therefore, it treats the learning of grammar as "an organised and progressive work of observation and systematisation of major paradigms and regularities of language" (p. 18), as Ferreira (2014) considers it.
