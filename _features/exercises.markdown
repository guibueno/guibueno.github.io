### In a nutshell

**Exercises** are focused practices that prompt and scaffold learners to produce communicative utterances in their target language.

### Within the narrative

Infected learners develop the capacity to also talk to other language bugs. Each bug is interested in one particular topic or action, such as knowing about the family, the house, or the routine of learners.

### Association with existing resources

In the past, language schools typically used printed materials (Liu, 2009, p. 521) and "audio-cassettes or audio CDs of pre-recorded listening materials" (Kukulska-Hulme; Shield, 2007, p. 2) to engage learners in speaking practice.

**LanguageBug** exercises are essentially adaptations of these materials, with a few important improvements:

* The pace of exercises is very fast, in order to make it very challenging,
* *Exercises* prompt learners with both visual/written and audio clues, and
* *Principles* will scaffold learners prior to practicing through exercises.

### Functions

* Engage learners in speaking practice from the beginning,
* Introduce learners to sentence structure without using grammar,
* Help learners build relevant and personal vocabulary, and
* Explain to learners why it is relevant to learn the contents in each exercise.

### Example: **Self-introduction**

#### What is it?

"*Self-introduction*" is the most important exercise within LanguageBug. It introduces learners to multiple sentences that are extremely relevant to any language speaker, such as "*My name is _____*"  and "*I live in ____*". 

By completing sentences with personal information, such as the color of their eyes ("*My eyes are ____*"), learners will also acquire vocabulary that is relevant to their own individual background and experiences.

#### Why?

* Essential sentences for communication and survival,
* Introduces learner to relevant, conversational vocabulary,
* Help learners become comfortable introducing themselves, and
* Implicitly teaches learners different sentence structures.

#### Script

* Show self-introduction sentence in Portuguese with a blank space.
* *Audio*: play audio of this incomplete sentence in Portuguese.
* Show the translation of that sentence in English.
* *Audio*: play audio of this incomplete sentence in Portuguese.
* *Audio*: play audio of the whole sentence (with sample answer).
* (If new vocabulary) Introduce learner to possible answers.
* Ask learner to repeat after the audio, with his/her information.
* Play complete audio again, and ask learners to repeat again.
* Repeat all steps with the following sentence.
* Show and play the audio of the two sentences in Portuguese.
* Ask learner to repeat those two sentences with his/her info.
* Repeat procedure, increasing the number of sentences.

### Scalability

Within the scope of this thesis project, **LanguageBug** only covers basic Novice-level content, but there are certainly more words and sentences that could be integrated to the exercises. In addition to that, it is always possible to keep improving the selection of words and expressions based on feedback from learners and user observation.

There could also be many other ways to foster speaking practice, besides the ones that **LanguageBug** features at this moment. Getting to know other approaches to language learning and teaching may provide insights on the creation of new exercises. The architecture of **LanguageBug** would make it easy to integrate them.

Finally, bugs could be further developed as characters with particular interests, so that learners could have different conversations with different bugs based on their interests. For example, a learner wishing to speak Portuguese in professional settings could learn relevant content by interacting with a "*Business Bug*" character.
