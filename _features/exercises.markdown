### In a nutshell

**Exercises** are focused practices that prompt and scaffold learners to produce communicative utterances in the target language.

### Within the narrative

### Association with existing resources

In the past, language schools typically used printed materials (Liu, 2009, p. 521) and "audio-cassettes or audio CDs of pre-recorded listening materials" (Kukulska-Hulme; Shield, 2007, p. 2) to engage learners in speaking practice.

### Functions

* Engage learners in speaking practice,
* Help learners build relevant and personal vocabulary,
* Introduce learners to sentence structure without using grammar,

### Example: **Self-introduction**

#### What is it?

"*Self-introduction*" is the most important exercise within LanguageBug. It introduces learners to multiple sentences that are extremely relevant to any language speaker, such as "*My name is _____*"  and "*I live in ____*". By completing sentences with personal information, such as the color of their eyes ("*My eyes are ____*"), learners will also acquire relevant vocabulary.

#### Why?

* Essential sentences for communication and survival,
* Introduces learner to relevant, conversational vocabulary,
* Help learners become comfortable introducing themselves, and
* Implicitly teaches learners different sentence structures.

#### Script

* Show self-introduction sentence in Portuguese with a blank space.
* *Audio*: play audio of this incomplete sentence in Portuguese.
* Show the translation of that sentence in English.
* *Audio*: play audio of this incomplete sentence in Portuguese.
* *Audio*: play audio of the whole sentence (with sample answer).
* (If new vocabulary) Introduce learner to possible answers.
* Ask learner to repeat after the audio, with his/her information.
* Play complete audio again, and ask learners to repeat again.
* Repeat all steps with the following sentence.
* Show and play the audio of the two sentences in Portuguese.
* Ask learner to repeat those two sentences with his/her info.
* Repeat procedure, increasing the number of sentences.

### Scalability

Within the scope of this thesis project, **LanguageBug** only covers basic Novice-level content, but there are certainly more words and sentences that could be integrated to the exercises. In addition to that, it is always possible to keep improving the selection of words and expressions based on feedback from learners and user observation.

Finally, there could be many other ways to foster speaking practice, besides the ones that **LanguageBug** features at this moment. Other approaches may provide insights on the creation of new exercises, which can easily be integrated to the core of the app.
