Duolingo Portuguese

+ Pick a goal
  Nice
  Though it feels better suited to Languagebug than to Duolingo

are you a beginner? yes

Lesson 1
Content:
  o homem
  a mulher
  o pão
  a mação
Images: sound (word pronounced) when select options

- 3 clicks (one to select, one to verity, one to continue)

- no language needed, just seeing pictures (at first only)

+ Uses translation
Yellow words

- Typing takes too much time

+ 2 voices: nice woman/man

- correct/wrong binary

. "turtle" speech mode (aaaa mee-nii-naa). nice, but...

- typying what I don't even know (that is, I haven't been taught)

+ typo recognition

- flexible progress bar that "punishes mistakrs"

- como/eat come/eats: translating words only can be a problem

. grammar tips: necessary? problematic?

+ correct sound / green light: pleasure



daily goal: 10 minuts, no speaking, content: a/a/um/uma/menino/menina/homm/mulher/beber/comer/água
2 sentences are equivalent to that



- no sentence production
expect: "Eu sou um menino!"

- continue buttone

- ela "BÊBE": Spanish accent

- typying: it accepts without accents, but considers it a typo. WTF! Not even Brazilians type with accents on cellphones.

+ characters from different cultures and ethnicities (still, it doesn't represent the Brazilian population)

- relevance: "She eats bread". Is this really important to know now?

+ egg breaking

- vocabulary/grammar: topic choice on mai menu

- "Eu não sou um menino"

+ phrases topic
