reinvented language learning? big claim

+ Pre-questionnaire before start to learn
  - How old?
  - How did you learn about it?
  - What is your main reason to learn Portuguese?


. Progress bar?

+ Green for correct

- Red for wrong. Binary.

. You listen after you choose the correct

+ Just one click. No "continue" button

- Slow animations


- Match the correct items. TUDO IGUAL NESSA PORRA!

- There is a continue button. And it feels slow. The app feels super slow. Too many animations? Too slow animations?

--- No "teaching", only questionning.

- Progress bar: you never know what's happening, or what will happen when you reach 5

-- A few different designs for the same exercise: matching translations. It seems that this is all that apps currently do.

-- Too many meaningless pictures

. Speech recognition feature.
