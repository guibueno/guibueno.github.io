+ Pre-questionnaire before start to learn
  - How old?
  - How did you learn about it?
  - What is your main reason to learn Portuguese?

. reinvented language learning? big claim

+ "You'll be saying your irst sentences in no time"

- First activity is a question of something not explained. (?)

. Progress bar?

+ Green for correct

- Red for wrong. Binary.

. You listen after you choose the correct

+ Just one click. No "continue" button

- Slow animations

. Lit translation. Not very well explained, but interesting.

- Match the correct items. TUDO IGUAL NESSA PORRA!

- There is a continue button. And it feels slow. The app feels super slow. Too many animations? Too slow animations?

- Bad microphone. Bad accents. no anti-pop. Sometimes.

+ Man/women voice variety.

--- No "teaching", only questionning.

- Progress bar: you never know what's happening, or what will happen when you reach 5

-- A few different designs for the same exercise: matching translations. It seems that this is all that apps currently do.

-- Too many meaningless pictures

-- Very little content after the first lesson. I learned "Oi", "Tchau", "Qual Ã© o seu nome", "Tudo bem?", ... probably just that. I didn't speak a word and I feel like this was a complete waste of time.

. Speech recognition feature.

--- I couldn't get the speech recognition to recognize what I say. With or without earphones with built-in mic. Being a native speaker. Even Siri popped-up. Suuuuuuuper slow. Had to quit and give up!

++ Review manager: nice, vocabulary list, downloadeble, etc. Super cool!
