Maybe focus on questions such as:

  - Uses audio? How often? How?
  - Uses speech? Speech recognition? How is that experience?
  - Does it make the person talk?
  - How much have I learned from taking the first lesson? What was the content explained?
  - How do the different platforms deal with grammar and structure?
  - How do I feel about my focus? The degree of challenge?
  - Takes keyboard input? How? How is the experience?
  - How does it control levels, content, progress, etc? (i.e.: dashboard, content manager).
