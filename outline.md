# Presentation Outline

{: class="post-title"}

1. Good afternoon, everyone. 
My name is Gui Bueno, 
I'm a foreign student from Brazil 
and I'm here to talk about something I'm very passtionate about,

2. which is: language learning. 
I have learned foreign languages for almost 15 years
and I have also taught languages for 3 years.
But it's funny, 'cause people are usually passionate about things that they are almost naturally very good at.

3. ... and I have actually struggled a lot with language learning in the past.
After 10 years of English courses, I couldn't even have a simple conversation in English.
And all that struggle was because of something called... 

4. foreign language anxiety, which is that fear, embarrassment, or shyness
that even thinking of speaking foreign languages in front of people may cause you.
In fact, if today I'm here speaking English in front of all of you and even a camera,
you can be sure that it's a huge achievement to me.

5. If you've ever experienced foreign language anxiety, you know what I'm talking about,
 And I'd love to hear your stories about that, so come to my booth, number 5. 
 And don't worry, this is not yet the end of my presentation! In fact, I'll now walk you through a...

6. very realistic scenario. Let's imagine that each one of you here really wants to learn Brazilian Portuguese.
For any reason. Maybe you're applying for a job in Brazil, 
or just making plans to visit Brazil, or you're getting married to a Brazilian person... 
Whichever reason, you just really want to learn Portuguese!

7. And so you'll pick up your mobile device and you'll search for language learning apps.
Among hundreds of options, you will probably download Babbel, Duolingo, and Memrise.

8. All these apps will prompt you with several games of translation matching: 
they'll give you a word in Portuguese, you pick the translation in English. 
Or vice-versa. But you won't stop there, for sure...

9. You will also install Rosetta-Stone, of course. 
After all, this is a multi-million dollar company, so these guys must really know what they are doing.

10. And when you use Rosetta-Stone, you'll match audio sentences in Portuguese with pictures, without using any English. 
You'll get excited and you'll be serious about practicing. 
After not too long, let's say... a week, I'm you'll be great, you'll be proficient, you'll be an expert at...

11. Touching your cellphone screen. 
Because that's what you'll be doing most of the time. 
And now you'll ask me: "But, Gui, will that make me a good Portuguese speaker?". 
And I'll have to be honest and say:

12. Absolutely not! Not in my opinion, at least. 
You become good at things as you do these things many times.
These apps may prompt you to speak every now and then, but this is not enough.

13. As a result, you'll end up thinking that language learning is not your thing.
But I'm here to tell you, that there is a very rare species of bug that may help you...

14. I introduce you to this bug, the LANGUAGE BUG!
Language Bugs are attracted by the smell of foreign language anxiety.
So they will find you and bite you, which will result in an..

12. infection! But don't worry, this is not a bad infection.
It's an infection as much as sipederman was infected by a spider, 
that is, it's an infection that will give you superpowers,

13. Language Learning Superpowers! 
Of course, you won't know exactly how to use your superpowers right away.
Again, just like Spiderman didn't know how to throw his web at the beginning.
But the LanguageBug app will 

14. help you get to know the specific superpowers you have.
It will make you think about the way you think when learning languages,
this is called metacognition

15. The app will then scaffold you to using those superpowers.
Step-by-step, introducing you to efficient strategies...

16. while also taking care of your emotional ()()()()()()()()
let you know that it takes time to fully develop a superpower.

17. Then, you will be ready train these superpowers
when talking to other bugs about various topics.

18. This is a speak-first approach,
so you will be speaking at all time.
And that's going to be your only task: speak. 
Embody your target language!

19. And finally, you'll record yourself speaking Portuguese,
so you can see how much you're improving, practice after practice (and even brag about it!)

20. Well, if you want to try LanguageBug's speak first approach,
visit my booth (number 5) and try out our live demo.

21. Thank you once again! My name is Gui Bueno. It's been a pleasure.
