## Introduction 

-- My name is Gui Bueno and I am from Brazil  
-- This project addresses language learning in general  
-- Since I'm Brazilian, Portuguese is what it teaches

-- **Building credibility**  
--- 15 years of language learning  
--- 3 years of language teaching  
  

-- **Problem statement**  
--- I know! Language learning is hard! But what makes it hard?  
--- Raise your hand if you've ever tried to learn a foreign language.  
--- Remain like this if you've ever "failed" at those attempts.  
--- As expected. There are some people in this situation!  
--- In the U.S., XX% of people do not learn Spanish/French
--- No wonder! There are way too many issues in language learning.  
--- Foreign languaxe anxiety, old teaching methods, lack of motivation.  

-- **Lack of information** is one thing we cannot include, though  
--- So many available services, that vary from ___ to ___.

-- **Strong beliefs**  
--- Some of them I cannot prove through research at the moment  
--- I have strong convictions based on teaching/learning experience  
--- _Speaking is primary_, just as children do (maybe? bad argument?)  
--- _Risk-taking_, that is, trial and error is crucial  
--- _Focused practice_, that is, going to the gym.

-- **Gym example**  
--- Let's think of language learning from a more embodied perspective.  
--- Being able to speak a language can be compared to going to the gym.  
--- You can find all kinds of information about weight-lifting.  
--- But there is a time in which you actually need to go there and train.  
--- Let's call that practice time. Train time. Deliberate practice. Wtv.
