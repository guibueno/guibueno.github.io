-- Solution  
  
  
* * *
  
  
## Introduction 

-- My name is Gui Bueno and I am from Brazil  
-- This project addresses language learning in general  
-- Since I'm Brazilian, Portuguese is what it teaches

-- **Building credibility**  
--- 15 years of language learning  
--- 3 years of language teaching  
  

-- **Problem statement**  
--- I know! Language learning is hard! But what makes it hard?  
--- Raise your hand if you've ever tried to learn a foreign language.  
--- Remain like this if you've ever "failed" at those attempts.  
--- As expected. There are some people in this situation!  
--- In the U.S., XX% of people do not learn Spanish/French
--- No wonder! There are way too many issues in language learning.  
--- Foreign languaxe anxiety, old teaching methods, lack of motivation.  

-- **Lack of information** is one thing we cannot include, though  
--- So many available services, that vary from ___ to ___.

-- **Strong beliefs**  
--- Some of them I cannot prove through research at the moment  
--- I have strong convictions based on teaching/learning experience  
--- _Speaking is primary_, just as children do (maybe? bad argument?)  
--- _Risk-taking_, that is, trial and error is crucial  
--- _Focused practice_, that is, going to the gym.

-- **Gym example**  
--- Let's think of language learning from a more embodied perspective.  
--- Being able to speak a language can be compared to going to the gym.  
--- You can find all kinds of information about weight-lifting.  
--- But there is a time in which you actually need to go there and train.  
--- Let's call that practice time. Train time. Deliberate practice. Wtv.

overly personal presentation approach:
  my name is gui
  studied english for x years
  taught 4 langs
  even the ones i was not profficient
  very critical of the landscape audit
  we could be doing more with less
  i've suffered from language learning anxiety
  languages are taught by apps a people in a terrible way
  sense of compleition
  right/wrong
  grammar
  attitude
  all bad approaches

draft approach:
  tis presentation is not completed
  my thesis is not completed
  it's all a work in progress
  i don't even speak fluent english
  this shouldn't all be a problem
  development is more important
  process over product
  need for a language learning tool that adopts that
  right/wtong binary
  grammar
  correct, grades, green lights
  these are all behaviors that inhibit learners
  self-improvement, kaizen should be the focus
  we like to iterate as designers
  on the assumption that doing it many times makes you do it right,
  but we think of our learners as people who need to get things right
  we think of our design products as fixed, products from a competitive perspectve
  how much our we still relying on the transmission model?
  we create standards and tests,
  we inhibit learners and make them 

   and 
  we think of assessment as proofs that learning has happened,
  without taking into account each persosn' individual trajectory

This presentation is not complete.

My thesis project is not complete, either.

What's wrong with not being finished?

We, designers, really value trial and error, testing, prototyping, iteration as part of our process.

But when it comes to our instructional products, we tend to think about assessment in a strict way.

Well... let me share a personal narrative about that.

I have studied English for over 10 years in Brazil. I always had great grades, I'd perform well on tests, I'd attend all classes.

As the years went by, I was always waiting for the finish line, that is, a time in which I'd say: "Now I have completed the English course, now I speak English."

Guess what? This has never happened. I spent those 10 years waiting for completion, instead of paving the way to become a fluent speaker.

In the end, I had a certificate saying I spoke English, but I wasn't able to have a conversation in English, to communicate, to watch a movie, or to even introduce myself in English.

### Feedback

> nicolepf: (in the intro you should mention that you were a language teacher)

> jhodrick [7:20 PM] Personal story, solid. I like the simple slides.

> michalola [7:20 PM] cool slides!!!!!

> jhodrick [7:21 PM] Subversive cliffhanger for your story! (edited)

> saorig [7:21 PM] I wish I can talk to audience like you do all the time..

> bhavanabudithi [7:21 PM] Simple slides. Amazing connection with the audience

> nissa [7:21 PM]  - "usually passionate about what good at" i like this as how you present a "twist" in your story - if going to ask "why" want to learn Portuguese, give us at least some example reasons (travel, friends, whatever) (edited)

> annwu [7:21 PM] Problem statement was very smoothly connected to what you’re gonna deal with, I like it. great flow

> bhavanabudithi [7:21 PM] humour!

> michalola [7:21 PM] :grinning:

> jhodrick [7:22 PM] I love the imagery. (edited)

> nissa [7:22 PM]  spiderman is a great reference

> nicolepf [7:23 PM] you are great at keep the audience paying attention to what you're saying

> martyb [7:23 PM] wonderful Touching You Screen moment, really feels like a pitch, which is great, good job just teasing your project, i'm into learn more

> saorig [7:23 PM] I'm so intrigued by your presentation and now I really want to go visit your cube!

> maaike [7:25 PM] I like the personal story.. might you also want to highlight your experience as a teacher even more? I think that gives you a lot of credibility.  I like the landscape audit to show your understanding of the competition. You might also highlight that this is a multimillion (billion?) dollar industry that you are approaching it very differently (and how it's different). REALLY be clear about how you're differentiating it. As always, great presenting style. Total time 3:45. Please add name to the end of your presentation (maybe contact info as well).

> nissa [7:27 PM] ways to get back to how you're different, maybe something like "get practice doing more than touching your screen" / "get practice ​*speaking*​ instead of touching your screen"
