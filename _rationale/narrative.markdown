### In a nutshell

At the end of each practice, learners can record their own speech in a **self-assessment video**, so they can witness their ongoing progress.

### Within the narrative


### Association with existing resources

In the professional and academic domains, foreign language speakers are often required to take oral proficiency tests. These tests may be administered in-person or thrugh videoconferencing tools.

For example, the New York University (NYU) may require its prospective international students to take *language placement tests*, offered by the American Language Institute (NYU ALI, n.d.). 

Similartly, the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) has been offering a popular test called the *ACTFL Oral Proficiency Interview* (ACTFL OPI) for over 20 years (ACTFL, n.d.).

In these tests, test takers are prompted to produce original speech in the tested language, which certified test takers will then analyze and rate. 

Within **LanguageBug** learners are their own test takers. Despite not having certified technical skills to assess their own speech, learners will certainly be able to notice progress by watching video after video.

### Functions

* Register speech samples continuously.
* Compare current and past speech samples to assess progress.
* Help learners become comfortable hearing their own FL speech.
* Allow learners to share their speech samples with their contacts.

### Example: **User Test**

#### Sample

During the user tests, I simulated the *self-assessment video* feature using the *Wizard of OZ* method (see: User Tests, Results). As a result, there are videos of both users speaking Portuguese after each exercise practice.

Nicole's "Yourself" exercise self-assessment video can be accessed at the following URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNAl6thkpkA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNAl6thkpkA).

#### Regular assessment: Standard framework

If a group of proficiency test takers analyze this video, they will certainly notice that Nicole's performance is marked by evident traces of beginner speech, such as: strong accent, slow pace, unusual rhythm, etc.

As a consequence, Nicole would be labeled a "Novice" speaker and her performance would probably receive a low grade. In this case, Nicole's speech was compared to a certain (so-called) **standard speech**.

#### Self-assessment: Progress framework

When Nicole watched the same video, she certainly noticed her speech differed from the Native speech introduced within **LanguageBug**. It is likely that she could not identify these differences with precision.

But she was also able to notice all the learning she had accomplished in only a few minutes: from not knowing how to say any sentence in Portuguese to knowing a few sentences, even if not perfectly spoken. 

In this case, Nicole is comparing her current self to herself before the practice. **Progress** is the ultimate goal. If Nicole did another exercise practice, it is likely that her performance would be even better.

### Scalability

User-generated videos bring several new affordances to the design of **LanguageBug**. As a result, there could be several enhancements to the *self-assessment video* feature, such as the following:

* Integrate multiple videos into a single "timeline of progress" video, 
* Allow users to follow the videos with their network of learners, and
* Measure/identify the time and content of each video to generate data.

None of these features has been tested our outlined at the moment.

### Current Options

* **Record**: records a video after each practice.
* **Watch**: plays any video recorded by the learner.
* **Share**: outputs the URL of the video on YouTube.

### Theoretical foundation

* Formative assessment
* Self-efficacy
* Self-motivation
